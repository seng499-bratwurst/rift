### Tool 1: `deviceCategories`

What the **deviceCategories** tool does: The API `deviceCategories` service returns all device categories defined in Oceans 3.0 that meet a filter criteria. A Device Category represents an instrument type classification such as CTD (Conductivity, Temperature & Depth Instrument) or BPR (Bottom Pressure Recorder). Devices from a category can record data for one or more properties (variables). The primary purpose of this service is to find device categories that have the data you want to access; the service provides the `deviceCategoryCode` you can use when requesting a data product via the dataProductDelivery web service.

#### Parameters for the deviceCategories tool:
All parameters are optional and should **only be used when the user provides relevant information otherwise fill null**:

- `deviceCategoryCode`
- `deviceCategoryName`
- `description`
- `locationCode`
- `propertyCode`
