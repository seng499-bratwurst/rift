Studying carbon dioxide in the ocean helps to understand how the ocean will be impacted by climate change
and respond to increasing fossil fuel emissions.The marine carbonate system is not well characterized in the
Arctic, where challenging logistics and extreme conditions limit observations of atmospheric CO2 flux and
ocean acidification. Here, we present a high-resolution marine carbon system data set covering the complete
cycle of sea-ice growth and melt in an Arctic estuary (Nunavut, Canada).This data set was collected through
three consecutive yearlong deployments of sensors for pH and partial pressure of CO2 in seawater (pCO2sw)
on a cabled underwater observatory.The sensors were remarkably stable compared to discrete samples: While
corrections for offsets were required in some instances, we did not observe significant drift over the
deployment periods. Our observations revealed a strong seasonality in this marine carbon system. Prior to
sea-ice formation, air–sea gas exchange and respiration were the dominant processes, leading to increasing
pCO2sw and reduced aragonite saturation state (OAr). During sea-ice growth, water column respiration and
brine rejection (possibly enriched in dissolved inorganic carbon, relative to alkalinity, due to ikaite
precipitation in sea ice) drove pCO2sw to supersaturation and lowered OAr to < 1. Shortly after polar
sunrise, the ecosystem became net autotrophic, returning pCO2sw to undersaturation. The biological
community responsible for this early switch to autotrophy (well before ice algae or phytoplankton blooms)
requires further investigation. After sea-ice melt initiated, an under-ice phytoplankton bloom strongly
reduced aqueous carbon (chlorophyll-a max of 2.4 mg L–1), returning OAr to > 1 after 4.5 months of
undersaturation. Based on simple extrapolations of anthropogenic carbon inventories, we suspect that this
seasonal undersaturation would not have occurred naturally. At ice breakup, the sensor platform recorded low
pCO2sw (230 matm), suggesting a strong CO2 sink during the open water season.

1. Introduction
As the Arctic warms at twice the rate of lower latitudes
(Richter-Menge et al., 2019), the Arctic Ocean’s role as
a significant sink for atmospheric CO2 (Bates and Mathis,
2009) is expected to be reduced, and its vulnerability to
negative climate impacts, such as acidification, to increase
(Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme [AMAP],
2018). However, the Arctic Ocean and associated shelf seas
lack comprehensive monitoring to provide conclusive car-
bon budgets or observations of interannual, annual,

seasonal, or daily cycles. The scarcity of high-temporal
resolution measurements presents a significant challenge
for accurately constraining net carbon exchange and its
future change in Arctic seas. The largest gap in observa-
tions occurs through the polar night, as the seasonal sea-
ice cover limits access by research vessels (AMAP, 2018).
In the absence of high-resolution observations, concep-
tual models describing annual Arctic marine carbon
cycling have needed to extrapolate between limited sea-
sonal data sets. Yager et al. (1995) described polynya re-
gions in the Arctic as strong annual sinks for atmospheric
CO2 because the seasonal cycle of the partial pressure of
CO2 in seawater (pCO2sw) is in-phase with the seasonal
cycle of sea-ice formation and melt. Yager et al. also sug-
gested that if wind speeds are high over a seasonally ice-
covered marine region before sea-ice formation in the fall,
the region could act as major sink for atmospheric CO2,
replacing much of the inorganic carbon consumed by net
production over the summer. The winter ice cover would
then prevent outgassing as pCO2sw reaches supersatura-
tion because of net respiration, mixing with CO2-rich deep
water, and restricted air–sea gas exchange. In the spring,
pCO2sw will decrease to undersaturation before ice
breakup due to net photosynthesis driven by ice-algal pro-
duction. This model has been applied to interpretations of
other seasonal ice zones, including flaw lead polynyas
(Else et al., 2012; Shadwick et al., 2011) and landfast ice
regions (Else et al., 2019). Indeed, the majority of studies
examining seasonal ice zones near the time of ice breakup
have found undersaturated pCO2sw, although Else et al.
(2019) suggested that under-ice phytoplankton blooms,
and not bottom-ice algal communities, are the most likely
drivers of this undersaturation.
Similarly, seawater pH and carbonate mineral satura-
tion state O, specifically calcite (OCa) and aragonite (OAr),
important indicators for ocean acidification, also follow
seasonal cycles. With the Arctic thought to be more vul-
nerable to acidification than any other ocean region
(Shadwick et al., 2013), these seasonal cycles also warrant
a deeper understanding. Through the winter, O in Arctic
surface waters has been observed to decrease due to res-
piration and mixing with subsurface waters (Chierici et al.,
2011). Over the spring and summer, photosynthetic
uptake of carbon by phytoplankton in the surface layer
decreases dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), increasing pH
and O (Shadwick et al., 2011). In the yearlong annual
study described by Chierici et al. (2011) and Shadwick et
al. (2011), prolonged periods of seasonal OAr undersatura-
tion in the surface were not observed, with the only winter
observation of undersaturation attributed to upwelling of
Pacific origin waters. Observations of CaCO3 undersatura-
tion in spring or summer can be attributed to sea-ice
meltwater and river runoff (Bates et al., 2009). Trends in
the Western Arctic suggest that within a few decades, the
entire upper water column may become undersaturated
with respect to the CaCO3 mineral aragonite (OAr) due to
enhanced freshwater storage and atmospheric uptake of
CO2 (Qi et al., 2016). The highest rates of acidification are
expected in the central Arctic, Canadian Basin, and Baffin
Bay (AMAP, 2018). However, shallow nearshore waters that
are seasonally covered by continuous landfast sea ice show
the largest vulnerability (AMAP, 2013). These environ-
ments partially shut down CO2 evasion during the winter
while still permitting metabolism of terrigenous and
marine organic carbon through respiration (Garneau et
al., 2006), which leads to decreasing pH and O.
Despite progress, most of our understanding of the
seasonal progression of the marine carbon system in Arc-
tic environments is largely strung together by limited
data, widely separated in space and time. The actual pro-
cesses controlling this progression are not as straightfor-
ward as one conceptual model and are likely to be very
different in different locations. One way of addressing this
issue is to establish long-term time-series stations utilizing
new autonomous sensor technology (Sastri et al., 2019).
Our goal here is to describe the seasonal marine car-
bon cycle in an Arctic continental shelf sea using an
autonomous sensor platform. In pursuit of this primary
goal, we also address the following objectives: (1) evalu-
ation and correction of autonomous pH and pCO2sw sen-
sor measurements using discrete samples and (2)
description of the oceanographic context for the auton-
omous measurements.
2. Study area
Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada, was selected as the Arc-
tic estuarine site for this experimental study (Figure 1).
Herein, we refer to the marine region of Cambridge Bay as
“CB,” to avoid confusion with the Hamlet of Cambridge
Bay (also known as Iqaluktuttiaq or ᐃᖃᓗᒃᑑᑦᑎᐊᖅ, mean-
ing “good fishing place”; Pitquhirnikkut Ilihautiniq, 2020).
CB is a coastal inlet with a wide, shallow entrance that
restricts exchange with the adjacent Dease Strait (a south-
ern limb of the Northwest Passage). The bay has a maxi-
mum depth of approximately 85 m. CB is an outlet for
a fairly large watershed (1,490 km2) on Victoria Island
discharging to the ocean via Freshwater Creek (Figure
1), which typically starts flowing in early June, has a peak
discharge of about 45 m3 s–1 in late June or early July, and
stops flowing in early November (Environment and Natu-
ral Resources Canada, 2019). CB experiences moderate
tidal influence semi-diurnally with an average daily range
of 0.4 m.
A landfast ice cover in the bay is typically established by
mid-October, reaching an average maximum thickness in
May of about 1.5 m (Oceans Networks Canada, 2017). In
winter, the region experiences weak tides and minimal
water movement beneath the sea-ice cover (Lewis and
Walker, 1970). During much of winter, the sea ice is cov-
ered by snow of variable depths depending on the year
but usually less than 0.3 m (Moon et al., 2019). Sea-ice
thinning begins around June, and by the second half of
July, CB is typically completely ice-free. The early summer
water column experiences a pronounced two-step stratifi-
cation, forced by a thin (<2 m) low-salinity layer caused by
Freshwater Creek runoff and sea-ice melt (Lewis and
Walker, 1970). Following an approximate 3-week period
of two-step stratification, wind-driven mixing deepens the
mixed layer to about 20-m depth, creating an isocline that
persists through fall and winter.

3. Methods
3.1. Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) underwater
platform
This study made use of the ONC Cambridge Bay Undersea
Community Observatory (Figure 2). The platform was si-
tuated on the ocean floor at 7-m below the sea surface,
approximately 120-m offshore (ONC; Figure 1). First
installed in September 2011, the power and communica-
tions are provided to the platform via an underwater
cable, enabling continuous real-time monitoring through-
out the year. Data are streamed live over the open access
ONC Ocean 2.0 data outlet (data.oceannetworks.ca). Wind
speed data were retrieved from the nearby onshore ONC
weather station. Table 1 details deployment intervals and
onboard sensors utilized by this study for the 2015, 2016,
and 2017 deployments.
3.2. Carbonate system sensors
To measure pCO2sw, Pro-Oceanus CO2-Pro CV sensors were
deployed on the ONC platform, starting in 2015. The CO2-
Pro uses a nondispersive infrared detector and executes an
automatic zero point calibration every 12 h (Jiang et al.,
2014). The CO2-Pro instrument was factory-calibrated by
Pro-Oceanus using National Institute of Standards and
Technology-traceable CO2 calibration gases prior to field
deployment and after, when possible. Pro-Oceanus reports
accuracy within 0.5% over the calibrated range (0–1,000
matm) and drift restricted to less than 10 matm year–1,
while measuring pCO2sw concentration with a precision
of 0.01 matm. CO2-Pro sensor deployments lasted approx-
imately 1 year (Table 1) before recovery and redeploy-
ment of a freshly calibrated sensor.
Starting in 2016, Satlantic SeaFET instruments were
used to measure pH on the ONC platform. The SeaFET
utilizes two ion-sensitive field effect transistors, housed
within both internal (FET|INT) and external (FET|EXT)
potentiometric cells (Martz et al., 2010; Bresnahan et al.,
2014). Both pH electrodes (pHINT and pHEXT) have demon-
strated exceptional stability over a range of practical sali-
nities (9–36) and temperatures (–1 °C to 35 °C; Martz et
al., 2010; Bresnahan et al., 2014; Kapsenberg et al., 2017;
Gonski et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2018). The SeaFET instru-
ments were calibrated at Satlantic and tested prior to
deployment in separate test tanks at ONC headquarters
and the Institute of Ocean Sciences (IOS), both in Victoria,
British Columbia. Satlantic reports that accuracy is within
0.05 pH, with a sensor precision of 0.0001 pH and stability
of 0.06 pH year–1. The SeaFET sensors were also exchanged
every year (Table 1).
3.3. Discrete sampling for sensor evaluation and
determining oceanographic context
Reference water samples were collected next to the sensor
platform at the sensor depth and at 2 m, as well as at
a secondary offshore site, for analysis of DIC and total
alkalinity (TA). These samples were collected through holes

triangles; the high-temporal resolution measurements were collected at the Ocean Networks Canada site. CTD-1, CTD-
2, MB, and CTD-3 are oceanographic transect stations. B1 is the location of ancillary water sampling and corresponds
to the near maximum depth of the bay. Freshwater Creek is the main source of riverine input to our study area. Dease
Strait is where the coastal inlet connects to the northwest passage. CTD = conductivity–temperature–depth. DOI:

drilled in the ice in winter or from small boats in summer
(Text S1, Figure S1, and Table S1). Water was collected with
1.25-L Niskin bottles, followed by bottom-filling 125-mL
borosilicate bottles with overflow of 3 volumes to prevent
atmospheric contamination (Dickson et al., 2007). Sam-
ples were then poisoned with 50 mL of a saturated
mercuric chloride (HgCl2) solution to prevent biological
activity. Depending on the time of year (Table S1), the
lapsed time before sample poisoning varied between
immediately (during the spring and summer) to an hour
(during the winter). Following preservation, samples were
capped using chlorobutyl-isoprene rubber stoppers and

aluminum caps and stored in the dark at 4 °C until anal-
ysis (Jiang et al., 2008). During the 2015–2016 deploy-
ment, reference samples were collected using a 5-L
Niskin bottle and 250-mL glass bottles with ground glass
stoppers sealed with Apiezon M grease and electrical tape,
according to standard sampling protocols (Dickson et al.,
2007). Conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) casts were
deployed concurrently with all water sample collections,
using an RBR Concerto calibrated by the manufacturer.
All 125-mL samples were analyzed at the University of
Calgary. DIC was determined after acid extraction by quan-
tifying the released CO2 by nondispersive infrared gas
spectroscopy (AIRICA and LiCOR-7000); TA was measured
by potentiometric titration using a semiautomated open-
cell titration system (AS-ALK2 Apollo SciTech; Cai et al.,
2010) with endpoint determination by modified Gran
plots (Grasshoff et al., 1999). All 250-mL samples were
analyzed for both DIC and TA at IOS. DIC was determined
coulometrically (Dickson et al., 2007) using either a SOM-
MA (Johnson et al., 1993) or VINDTA extraction system
and UIC, Inc., model no. 5011 coulometers. TA was mea-
sured using a semiautomated open-cell potentiometric
titration system, with end point determination by nonlin-
ear least-squares fitting (Dickson et al., 2007). All measure-
ments at the University of Calgary and IOS were calibrated
against certified reference materials provided by Andrew
Dickson from Scripps Institute of Oceanography. Univer-
sity of Calgary measurements had a precision better than
4 mmol kg–1 for DIC and 3 mmol kg–1 for TA. At IOS,
precision, based on the average standard deviation
between triplicate samples, was better than 2 mmol kg–1
for DIC and 5 mmol kg–1 for TA. Independent reference pH
and pCO2sw values used for sensor assessment were calcu-
lated from the measured DIC and TA at in situ tempera-
ture, salinity, and pressure (Table 1) using inorganic
carbon dissociation constants from Lueker et al. (2000),
the bisulfate ion acidity constant of Dickson (1990), and
the boron-to-chlorinity ratio of Lee et al. (2010) in CO2SYS
(Van Heuven et al., 2011).
In order to assess air–sea CO2 exchange and/or off-
shore ecological processes, ideally the in situ carbon sen-
sors would have been positioned close to the surface and
further offshore. To assess the spatial representativeness of
the platform, we also collected water samples and de-
ployed CTD casts regularly along a transect extending
0.65 km into the bay (Figure 1). Only CTD data were
collected at sites between ONC and B1 (CTD-1, CTD-2,
MB, CTD-3; Figure 1), whereas ancillary water samples
were collected at depths of 2 m, 7 m (to match the plat-
form), 30 m, and 70 m at station B1 (near maximum
depth in CB). The rationale for the selection of these sites
is described in the Supplemental Materials.
4. Instrument and sensor platform
performance
4.1. pH sensor performance and correction
Some quality control and correction of the SeaFET sensor
data were deemed necessary based on initial data

(field effect transistors, housed within external potentiometric cells) versus discrete sample pH values calculated from
measured dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity, using CO2SYS, for the years (a) 2016–2017 (n = 13) and (b)
2017–2018 (n = 7). Type II linear regression was used to calculate slope (c1) and root mean square error for the

inspection. Highly variable sensor values over the first 10
days of each deployment were observed due to SeaFET
instability caused by sensor reconditioning as described
by Bresnahan et al. (2014). These data were flagged and
excluded. Discrepancies in uncorrected pHINT
raw and pHEXT
raw
through both deployments also existed, as well as temper-
ature discrepancies in the SeaFET thermistor response
when compared to the co-located Sea-Bird SeaCAT (Table
1; Duke, 2019). New calibration coefficients were calcu-
lated for each reference point following Bresnahan et al.
(2014), using measured FET|EXT voltages, in situ temper-
ature and salinity from the colocated Sea-Bird SeaCAT, and
discrete sample pH. These single point coefficients were
then averaged to give a multipoint calibration coefficient
used to calculate pH from FET|EXT voltage and the Nernst
slope.
Figure 3 shows a comparison of pH calculated from
discrete DIC and TA samples (pHdisc
DIC−TA) with sensor va-
lues (pHsensor
final ). A type II linear regression was used to
assess sensitivity (c1 or slope), and the root mean square
error (RMSE) was calculated to assess uncertainty. In Fig-
ure 3, a sensor offset would be illustrated by separation
between the regression lines and the 1:1 line. A slope
significantly different than 1 would indicate a problem

with the sensor response over the range of measured va-
lues, and the systematic placement of points either above
or below the 1:1 line as a function of time would indicate
sensor drift. We saw none of these problems with the Sea-
FET sensor in either year. Even prior to correction, the raw
regression line (blue dotted line) was close to the 1:1 line,
with a slope not significantly different from 1. Sensor cor-
rection (red regression line) as described above did improve
these metrics slightly. RMSE (around 0.03 pH units in both
years) was higher than is typically desired, but this value
includes uncertainty in both of the sensor measurements
and in pH and pCO2sw calculated from DIC and TA.
4.2. pCO2sw sensor performance and correction
The CO2-pro pCO2sw sensor (pCO2sensor
final ) performance
against discrete samples (pCO2disc
DIC−TA) is shown in Figure
4. The initial calibration of the Pro-Oceanus sensors was
not as robust as for the SeaFETs, as we observed offsets
(separation of the blue dotted line from the 1:1 line)
during all deployments. However, sensor drift was not
apparent, as the distribution of points around the 1:1 line
through time across all three deployments showed no
discernable pattern. Also, the slopes of the regression lines
were not significantly different (P < .05) from 1.
Correction of all pCO2sw data sets therefore focused on
reducing offsets. Correction of the 2015–2016 data used
a postdeployment multipoint factory calibration from Pro-
Oceanus of –24.15 matm, the mean difference when com-
pared to NIST-traceable CO2 calibration gases. This correc-
tion factor was used to increase sensor pCO2sw by
a constant throughout the deployment. For 2016–2017,
no postdeployment factory calibration was available, as
the infrared lamp failed before platform recovery. The
calculated mean difference between raw sensor data and
reference samples of 24.56 matm was instead used as
a correction factor throughout deployment. During the
2017–2018 deployment, the sensor quite significantly
overestimated pCO2sw through the entirety of the deploy-
ment with a mean difference relative to reference samples
of 88.25 matm. This calculated value was again used as
a constant correction factor due to sensor failure prior
to recovery. Regression lines for the corrected data (red
lines, Figure 4) show that these calibration approaches
were effective in removing the observed offsets. Final RMSE
was highest in the 2017–2018 deployment (+30 matm),
but again this reflects uncertainty in both the sensor and
the discrete samples. The final corrected sensor pH and
pCO2sw time series of ONC over all three deployments is
shown in Figure 5. A more extensive analysis of the perfor-
mance of pCO2sw and pHsensors isavailable in Duke(2019).
Overall, discrete calibration samples appear to be
needed in most cases only at deployment, following an
appropriate conditioning period for the SeaFET (Bresna-
han et al., 2014; Duke, 2019), and at recovery. However,
the CO2-Pro deployments indicate that collecting addi-
tional calibration samples mid-deployment, when possi-
ble, is still beneficial as a robust way to quality control
the data.

and salinity from the ONC platform to station B1, located

2012). During winter (Figure 6a and b), we observed a rel-
atively deep mixed layer, with constant temperature and
salinity to a depth of about 25 m along the whole transect.
During the ice melt/river runoff period, the water column
above the sensor platform became stratified, with a salinity
of 2 at the surface and 28 at 7-m depth (Figure 6c). During
this period, the ONC platform (at 7-m depth) experienced
much cooler and saltier water (–1.0 °C, salinity of 27) than
was at the surface (3 °C, 2–4). During summer (Figure 6e and
f), open water and wind mixing resulted in mixed layer deep-
ening (to approximately 10 m), reestablishing similar condi-
tions between the platform depth and the surface. During
sea-ice formation (Figure 6g and h), the ONC platform was
well within the mixed layer (which had deepened to 25 m).
Overall, water properties similar to the platform location
were observed at B1 at a similar (7 m) depth, apart from
slightly warmer water near shore in the fall.
We confirmed that the biogeochemical measurements
at the ONC site are representative of the offshore during
most seasons by comparing discrete DIC and TA samples
collected at both 2 and 7 m at the ONC platform and B1
(Figure 7). As expected, values were similar at both depths
on and offshore through the winter months and into the
late spring. The data from 2 and 7 m at both ONC and B1
diverged in summer (July 3 and 10), as DIC, TA, and salinity
values at the surface plummeted while temperature rose,
likely due to a combination of river runoff from Freshwa-
ter Creek (Figure 1) and sea-ice melt. Following the melt/
runoff period (after July 20), the surface stratification
broke down, and the DIC, TA, salinity, and temperature
values measured at the ONC platform depth were again
representative of the surface mixed layer (Figure 7). Cor-
relation coefficients (Pearson’s r) for ONC 7 m (the sensor
depth) compared to ONC 2-m DIC values were strong all
year (0.67) but improve when excluding July 3 and 10
(0.93). Comparing the sensor location to B1 7 m, DIC was
strongly correlated year-round (0.88). Note that we
observed warming at the ONC site about 2 weeks earlier
than at B1 (May 16 vs. June 3; Figure 7c). Overall, the
platform was chemically different from the surface for

about 2 weeks due to ice melt and runoff in spring but

due to radiative forcing.
5. Biogeochemical cycles: Seasonal overview
Given the above results, the platform should be useful for
understanding biogeochemical processes in this landfast
ice region, at least from late summer to the beginning of
ice breakup. Of all of the deployments, the data from 2016
to 2017 offer the most complete picture, when both the
pH and pCO2sw sensors were operational and we collected
most of our discrete samples (Table S1). In this section, we
summarize the broad seasonal patterns observed in the
biogeochemical and physical parameters (Figure 8). Our
criteria for defining the seasonal intervals are described in
Text S2.
Through the fall, pCO2sw was undersaturated with
respect to the atmosphere but steadily increased as sea
ice began to form (Figure 8a and b). On January 19, the
waters at the platform became supersaturated with
respect to the atmosphere and then continued to increase
through the early winter until reaching a maximum on
March 5 of 509 matm. pCO2sw began to decrease shortly
after (around the start of the “late winter” period) and
continued to decrease at a steady rate as the ice continued
to grow toward its maximum thickness on May 24. pCO2sw
became undersaturated with respect to the atmosphere by
May 5. The drawdown in pCO2sw accelerated at the end of
May, as light penetration increased due to snow melt on
the surface (Figure 8f, the period we have identified as
“spring”) and as the sea ice began to thin, increasing pri-
mary production. pCO2sw reached a minimum of 223
matm on June 23, and the site entered the open water
season significantly undersaturated with respect to atmo-
spheric pCO2 (difference of –177 matm).
Trends in pH and dissolved oxygen also showed a dis-
tinct seasonal cycle. Dissolved oxygen appeared to be
inversely correlated to pCO2sw except during the fall sea-
son (Figure 8c), while pH was inversely correlated with
pCO2sw throughout the entire study period (Figure 8d).

From freeze-up through spring, the correlation coeffi-
cients (Pearson’s r value) between O2 and both pCO2sw
and pH were >0.89. Salinity (Figure 8g) was strongly cor-
related with sea-ice growth and decay, increasing from
about 26 to a maximum of 29 as the ice thickened and
then decreasing at the onset of ice melt. Chlorophyll fluo-
rescence (Figure 8e) was low through most of the winter
season but began to increase slightly in early April and
then peaked rapidly after melt onset.
Carbonate system variables calculated from the sensor-
based pH and pCO2sw observations using CO2SYS are
shown in Figure 9. The DIC and TA results generally track
the same seasonal pattern as pCO2sw (and inverse to pH),
but we did observe seasonal changes in the DIC:TA ratio

(Figure 9c). Conditions of aragonite undersaturation (OAr
< 1) were observed for 134 consecutive days through the
winter into spring from January 17, 2017, through May 31,
2017 (Figure 9d).
5.1. Fall uptake
During the fall season, seawater temperatures were drop-
ping (Figure 8h) leading to decreasing pCO2sw (Figure 8b).
Yet during this time, DIC increased by approximately 150
mmolkg–1 (Figure 9a). Given that open water conditions
persisted during this time period (Figure 8a), we hypothe-
size that air–sea gas exchange and net respiration were
providing a prominent source of DIC to our site through
the fall.To calculate the magnitude of air–sea gas exchange
during this period, we used the bulk parametrization:
FCO2 ¼ αkΔpCO2ð1−CiÞ;
ð1Þ
where α is the solubility of CO2(g) in seawater as a function
of temperature and salinity (Weiss, 1974), k is the gas
transfer velocity according to Wanninkhof (2014), Ci is the
fractional ice coverage, and ΔpCO2 is the gradient in pCO2
between the platform and the atmosphere (constant value
of 407 matm from Butterworth and Else, 2018). Using this
approach and wind speed from the onshore weather sta-
tion, we calculated that air–sea gas exchange increased
the DIC concentration by 11.9 mmolkg–1 at the site. The
majority of the DIC increase must therefore have been
caused either by net respiration or potentially brine rejec-
tion later in the season (described in the next section).
Fluxes varied from 0 to –28.8 mmol m–2 day–1 with an
average flux of –4.8 mmol m–2 day–1 during this time,
comparable to the open water average flux estimated in
the region of –5 mmol m–2 day–1 (Ahmed and Else, 2019).
With the pCO2 gradient between seawater and the atmo-
sphere remaining relatively constant, variability in the
exchange rate was driven by wind events. The largest
fluxes coincided with wind speeds over 11 m s–1. Consis-
tent with observations in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago
(Ahmed et al., 2019), the site acted as a net sink for atmo-
spheric CO2 in the fall, replacing inorganic carbon con-
sumed by net production over the proceeding summer,
with sea ice forming before the site reached equilibrium.
5.2. Sea-ice growth
Although the landfast ice cover was not firmly established
at the site until October 19, the Canadian Ice Service

reported drifting ice on October 9 (start of the “early win-
ter” period). Figure 8d and g show that dissolved oxygen
and salinity started increasing even earlier in October,
while DIC (Figure 9a) began to increase at a similar time.
These increases are all consistent with brine rejection,
suggesting that ice formation may have started even ear-
lier, perhaps as early as October 1.
By comparing DIC with dissolved oxygen and interpret-
ing relationships within the context of the seasons, we can
make inferences about which biogeochemical processes
are dominant (Figure 10): Brine rejection (strongest when
ice growth is fastest) should cause increases in both DIC
and O2, net respiration (dominant under light-limited con-
ditions) should cause an increase in DIC and a decrease in
O2, and net autotrophy (dominant when solar radiation is
available) should cause DIC to decrease while O2 increases.
Figure 10 shows that through most of the month of
October, a clear signal of brine rejection was present in
both the DIC and O2 data. During brine rejection, impu-
rities are rejected from the sea ice, most notably salts
(apparent in Figure 8g) but also dissolved gases (Tison et
al., 2017). The positive correlation between DIC and O2
through October is strong evidence for brine rejection
being an important controlling process, which must have
continued throughout the ice growth period.
The detail that this data set provides during the ice
growth season allows for insights into two key paradigms
of carbon cycling beneath sea ice (Figure 11). First is the
“seasonal rectification” hypothesis (Yager et al., 1995),
which predicts that pCO2sw beneath sea ice likely becomes
supersaturated due to net respiration and brine rejection.
Our data seem to support this hypothesis, as pCO2sw
became supersaturated about 3 months after freeze-up.
The second is the “sea-ice carbon pump” hypothesis (Rys-
gaard et al., 2007) which predicts that DIC should be
rejected at higher rates than TA due to the formation of
calcium carbonate (ikaite) crystals in the sea ice. Our data
also appear to support this hypothesis, as we observed an
increasing DIC:TA ratio in the winter surface mixed layer
following freeze-up. Past studies using bottle measure-
ments (summarized by Else et al., 2019) have not pub-
lished time series of DIC:TA ratios under sea ice; using
sensors may be the only way to resolve such subtle
changes in the carbonate system.
Figure 11 shows key carbonate system parameters for
the early winter period in greater detail. The increase in
pCO2sw to supersaturation is likely driven by a combination
of net respiration and brine rejection, although a switch
from positively correlated DIC/O2 to negative correlation
is apparent in Figure 10 beginning in early January, sug-
gesting that net respiration became the dominant control
in the second half of this season. An interesting feature of
Figure 11a is the rapid increase in pCO2sw that occurs
throughout this time period. If simple brine rejection and
net respiration were the key factors in the pCO2sw
increase, one would expect pCO2sw to increase most rap-
idly earlier in winter, when ice formation is fastest and
organic material from the summer season would be most
available. The increase in the pCO2sw accumulation rate in
mid-December was likely tied to an increase in the Revelle
factor as the DIC:TA ratio increased (Figure 11c and e). The
Revelle factor is a measure of the relative increase in
pCO2sw with an increase in DIC as carbon speciation con-
centrations change. In this study, the Revelle factor
increased from near 17 at the end of fall to a maximum
of around 19 at the end of early winter, resulting in a more
pronounced response in pCO2sw to a change in DIC (Fig-
ure 9e). In turn, the increasing DIC:TA ratio was likely
a result of ikaite precipitation and retention in the ice,
as predicted by Rysgaard et al. (2007).
These findings suggest an interesting link between the
sea-ice carbon pump and seasonal rectification paradigms.
To our knowledge, winter supersaturation of pCO2sw
under a sea-ice cover has not actually been observed pre-
viously in the Arctic. The accumulation of dissolved CO2 to
near saturation has been observed (Else et al., 2019), and
studies that began observations later in spring have noted
undersaturation prior to ice breakup (Geilfus et al., 2012;
Else et al., 2019). Initial chemical conditions, combined
with the amount of ikaite precipitation, may play a possi-
bly important role in pCO2sw accumulation beneath ice.
For example, a region with high initial Revelle factor and
significant ikaite production would experience higher
amplitude pCO2sw changes than a region with low initial
Revelle factor and minimal ikaite production.
The overall increase in the DIC:TA ratio and the Revelle
factor over the early winter led to seasonal undersatura-
tion of aragonite (Figures 9d and 11c). Previous studies
reporting the annual cycle of OAr in seasonally ice-covered
Arctic waters did not report prolonged periods of under-
saturation through the winter at the surface (Chierici et
al., 2011; Shadwick et al., 2011). The prolonged

undersaturated winter waters we observed are potentially
corrosive to calcifying benthic fauna (bivalves and echino-
derms) found on the seafloor in CB (Vancouver Aquarium
Marine Science Centre, 2016), implying that this area
could be particularly vulnerable to future ocean
acidification.
5.3. Polar sunrise
The maximum pCO2sw beneath the ice occurred on March
5, 2017, shortly after the first occurrence of a measurement
of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)  2 mmol m–2
s–1 at the platform depth on February 28 (Figure 12); 2
mmol m–2 s–1 is described as the lower light limit of ice algae
(Horner and Schrader, 1982; Gosselin et al., 1986). Follow-
ing this “under-ice sunrise,”pCO2sw and O2 patterns remain
anticorrelated, suggesting that the observed drawdown was
driven by an ecosystem switch toward net autotrophy at low
light levels (average PAR values of 1.2 + 0.7 mmol m–2 s–1
through late winter; Figure 10). Chlorophyll-a concentra-
tions steadily increased but remained very low through this
period (Figure 12c). The observed DIC drawdown, with
nearly no change in salinity or temperature during this
time, was enough to drive pCO2sw to undersaturation with
respect to the atmosphere after May 5 (Figure 12a). Our
data confirm that photosynthetic drawdown of CO2 starts
earlier in the season than suggested by Leu et al. (2015),
before surface melt allows substantial light penetration (by
more than 60 days in the case of our study).
These late winter observations led us to ask what pho-
tosynthetic community might be responsible for a draw-
down of 152.8 mmol kg–1 of DIC between polar sunrise
and the onset of melt. In the nearby Dease Strait, Camp-
bell et al. (2017) reported particulate organic carbon in ice
algae equal to approximately 2,000 mg m–2 on May 25,
2014. Using this value and applying a simple calculation
discussed in Else et al. (2019), the total calculated uptake
of DIC by ice algae would equate to only 6.3 mmol kg–1
over the CB surface mixed layer. Similarly, using observed
chlorophyll-a concentrations (Figure 12c) and a carbon:
chlorophyll-a ratio of 60:1, we can infer pelagic biomass

fixation of only 0.26 mmol kg–1 of DIC. As carbon:chloro-
phyll ratios can be quite variable (Jakobsen and Markager,
2016), we tried varying the ratio by an order of magnitude
in either direction (i.e., 6:1 to 600:1), but this only pro-
duced a DIC fixation of 0.02–2.6 mmol kg–1. However, the
relative magnitudes of the calculated sympagic (i.e., ice-
associated) and pelagic algal communities during this
period are consistent with previously reported values (Gra-
dinger, 2009). Inclusive of the uncertainty, the production
in these communities is not even of the same order of
magnitude as the drawdown we report. Benthic algal pro-
duction is another process that could potentially be respon-
sible, given the proximity of the platform to the seafloor,
but benthic production in a similar environment at this
time of year was barely detectable (Horner and Schrader,
1982). The prokaryotic process of nitrification that involves
CO2 fixation might have contributed to DIC drawdown, but
reported rates have been very low (Firth et al., 2016). Hav-
ing ruled out ice algae, phytoplankton, benthic microalgae,
and bacterial nitrifiers as possible communities contribut-
ing significantly to the sunrise drawdown, another possible
explanation for DIC drawdown without a matching increase
in chlorophyll concentration may be tied to a different
component of the microbial ecosystem. Despite harsh
conditions through the polar night, virtually all taxonomic
groups of Arctic microbes are sustained under the ice (We-
slawski et al., 1999; Sherr and Sherr, 2003; Terrado et al.,
2009; Iversen and Seuthe, 2011; Niemi et al., 2011). One
possibility is that under low temperatures, large quantities
of EPS are being produced without producing chlorophyll
(as in winter sea ice; Krembs et al., 2002). Another possi-
bility is that a tight coupling between primary production
and grazing keeps chlorophyll levels low. Significant grazing
of sea-ice algae during this period is unlikely; past studies
have shown that grazing by micro- and meiofauna within
the sea ice is negligible (Michel et al., 2002) and that graz-
ing of ice algae by amphipods does not become significant
until ice melt (Michel et al., 1996; Gradinger and Bluhm,
2010). However, Seuthe et al. (2007) found that common
Arctic copepod species rapidly become active under the ice
at polar sunrise and may consume enough phytoplankton
to control standing stocks. Thus, grazing within the water
column is a viable hypothesis to explain carbon drawdown
during this time period. Without direct observations of the
microbial community or grazing activity over the deploy-
ment interval, we cannot definitively attribute the sunrise
DIC drawdown to a specific community, but understanding
these pathways should be a priority for future research.

We also considered this late-winter period in the con-
text of the sea-ice pump hypothesis.While the retention of
ikaite in sea ice during freezing constitutes one lever of
the pump (Section 5.2), the other lever is the release of
ikaite during ice melt. The release of ikaite and its subse-
quent dissolution in the water column will increase both
DIC and TA, but at a 1:2 (DIC:TA) ratio which in turn low-
ers pCO2 (Rysgaard et al., 2007). Indeed, we did observe
a decrease in the DIC:TA ratio at this time (Figure 9c),
coincident with the strong decrease in pCO2 (Figure 8b).
Although sea ice was still growing slowly at this time,
Geilfus et al. (2016) showed that ikaite release from sea
ice can occur before melt onset. We plan to investigate the
potential to draw inferences about ikaite precipitation and
dissolution from this data set in future work, but a strong
biological drawdown in the late winter period is still
required to explain observed decreases in DIC and TA
(Figure 9a and b).
5.4. Spring bloom
At the onset of snowmelt (May 24, 2017), PAR transmis-
sion increased by two orders of magnitude, followed by
a rapid increase in water column chlorophyll and decline
in pCO2sw (Figure 13). The evolution of the carbon system
during this period can be explained as the result of an
under-ice phytoplankton bloom, consistent with observa-
tions under similar landfast ice conditions (Fortier et al.,
2002; Mundy et al., 2009, 2014; Arrigo et al., 2012). How-
ever, the bloom we recorded at our site, with maximum
chlorophyll-a of 2.4 mg L–1, was significantly lower than
observed elsewhere, for example, 12 mg L–1 in Fortier at al.
(2002), 25 mg L–1 in Mundy et al. (2009), 18 mg L–1 in
Arrigo et al. (2012), and 11 mg L–1 in Mundy et al. (2014).
An interesting feature revealed by the high-temporal res-
olution data is the obvious diurnal pattern in chlorophyll-
a (Figure 13c), with a similar (although less pronounced)
pattern in pCO2sw. Under-ice biological communities are
well-adapted to low-light conditions (Mundy et al., 2009),
and sudden increases in light availability may lead these
communities to use a photoacclimation strategy such as
nonphotochemical quenching (Falkowski and LaRoche,
1991; Macintyre et al., 2000). During this time period, the
chlorophyll-a signal was visibly anti-correlated with PAR
on a diurnal time scale, likely due to fluorescence quench-
ing (Figure 13c and d). Nonetheless, diurnal pCO2sw min-
ima appeared to occur at midday along with O2 maxima,
suggesting that primary production was still more effi-
cient during periods of higher irradiance.

During this under-ice phytoplankton bloom, the water
once again became supersaturated with respect to arago-
nite (Figure 13b). Our site appears to follow a seasonal
trend in CaCO3 saturation states similar to those reported
from other Arctic regions, where high rates of phytoplank-
ton primary production and net ecosystem production act
to decrease both DIC and pCO2sw in summer, increasing
CaCO3 saturation states (Bates et al., 2009). On the other
hand, freshwater from either river runoff or sea-ice melt can
decrease saturation states in surface waters (Yamamoto-
Kawai et al., 2009), but the shallow stratification at our site
during spring (Figure 6) precluded observation of that
phenomenon from the ONC platform at 7-m depth.
6. Carbon drawdown
Our study site in Cambridge Bay is likely a net annual sink
for atmospheric CO2. Through the fall, the site acted as
a prominent sink for atmospheric carbon, with an average
air–sea gas flux of –4.8 mmol m–2 day–1. Entering the
open water season at the end of spring pCO2sw at the
platform depth was again undersaturated, and although
the platform was isolated from the surface by stratification
for 3 weeks in early July, discrete samples collected at the
surface through that time (Figure 7) indicated that sur-
face pCO2sw remained undersaturated.
The observed period of 134 days of OAr undersatura-
tion during winter and spring of the 2016–2017 deploy-
ment is, to the best of our knowledge, the longest period
of under-ice Arctic surface water OAr undersaturation yet
reported. Based on the assumption that surface waters in
CB share similar exposure to anthropogenic emissions as
surface waters of the Canada Basin, we can estimate the
anthropogenic contribution to the DIC load in Cambridge
Bay (Tanhua et al., 2009). Given the typical inorganic car-
bon properties in CB, if the anthropogenic CO2 compo-
nent of DIC (40 + 5 mmol kg–1, from Tanhua et al., 2009)
were subtracted from our calculated DIC values, then OAr
would be 0.33 + 0.02 higher. This higher value means
that during preindustrial times, OAr undersaturation
would not likely have occurred in CB, assuming that all
other environmental conditions were the same (e.g., tem-
perature, salinity, net ecosystem production, sea-ice thick-
ness, and growth duration). Therefore, we conclude that
the observed seasonal OAr undersaturation is likely caused
by the biologically induced seasonality of OAr, superim-
posed on a decline in OAr due to long-term ocean acidifi-
cation similar to the findings of Bates et al. (2009).
7. Conclusions
Based on our results, autonomous marine observing plat-
forms equipped with onboard carbon system sensors have
the potential to provide valuable information on carbon
cycling in the Arctic. Our recommendations for long-term
Arctic deployments include allowing for appropriate pre-
deployment sensor conditioning periods; collecting high-
quality, discrete reference samples at least at deployment
and recovery and, when possible, throughout the deploy-
ment interval; and deploying colocated sensors for other
biogeochemical variables, such as O2 and chlorophyll
fluorescence.
As is often the case, the location of the sensor platform
was a compromise between logistics and scientific objec-
tives. Nonetheless, our results show that the site is repre-
sentative of the greater sea-surface mixed layer in the bay
after sea-ice formation and development of the winter
mixed layer. Stratification in the spring isolated the plat-
form from the air–sea interface, and therefore, the plat-
form did not provide information on surface conditions
for approximately 3 weeks during 2017. Manning et al.
(2020) showed how important this period can be for
methane fluxes in CB, but the platform’s current location
limited it from resolving air–sea gas fluxes for CO2 during
this time. However, the platform was still representative of
offshore conditions at similar depths year-round. Future
users of physical and biogeochemical data produced at
bottom-moored observatories, even in shallow waters,
should be aware of such seasonal constraints when inter-
preting data.
Our seasonal analyses showed that through the fall,
pCO2sw was undersaturated with respect to the atmo-
sphere, acting as a net sink for air–sea gas exchange. Fol-
lowing sea-ice freeze-up, brine rejection and respiration
drove pCO2sw to supersaturation with respect to the atmo-
sphere, and aragonite to undersaturation. These are the
first observations of prolonged (130 day) seasonal arago-
nite undersaturation in surface waters of the Arctic.
Shortly after light availability under the ice began to
increase yet was still very low, the ecosystem at the plat-
form changed from net heterotrophic to net autotrophic,
driving pCO2sw back to undersaturation well before sea ice
had begun to melt. During this late winter period, re-
ported growth in ice algae, observed water column chlo-
rophyll-a used to infer phytoplankton production, and
assumed benthic microalgal production were insufficient
to explain the sunrise DIC drawdown. A likely possibility is
that grazing within the water column kept pelagic phyto-
plankton stocks low, while production decreased DIC. The
lack of under-ice ecosystem observations during this time
period highlights the need for further investigation. As the
sea ice melted in the spring and light availability increased
in the underlying water column, an under-ice phytoplank-
ton bloom was able to draw down a significant amount of
carbon before the open water season, effectively increas-
ing pH and restoring aragonite supersaturation. Although
the sensor platform could not measure surface pCO2sw
shortly after ice melt, it provided strong evidence that this
region is a significant sink for atmospheric CO2 through-
out the open water season.
