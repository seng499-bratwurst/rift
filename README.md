# rift
Backend for Bratwurst project written in C# using the .NET framework.

## Getting Started

To get started with developing the Rift project, install the [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

Once installed, to run the server:

* Navigate to the `/App` subdirectory
* Run `dotnet run` in the shell of your choice

## Contributions

We will be using the [Microsoft .NET Coding Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/). A linter will be set up soon, but until then I trust y'all to self-police.
