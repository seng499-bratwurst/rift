Abstract 
 
In this thesis, I present a unique temporal study of phytoplankton, nutrient and 
environmental dynamics that focussed on the transitional period between sea-ice cover 
conditions and open waters in a coastal inlet of the Canadian Arctic during 2016. I also 
compared the 2016 experimental data with continuous observations made by the Ocean 
Networks Canada (ONC) underwater observatory. Surface seawater sampling was 
conducted in Cambridge Bay with high temporal resolution from June 16 to August 3, to 
measure phytoplankton carbon and nitrate utilisation, silica production, phytoplankton 
biomass, phytoplankton taxonomy and dissolved nutrients. Throughout the study period, 
nitrate concentrations averaged 0.67 ± 0.08 µmol L-1, and chlorophyll a and primary 
production were low at 0.11 ± 0.005 µg L-1 and 0.25 ± 0.02 µmol C L-1 d-1, respectively. 
The presence of sea-ice reduced physical mixing, which resulted in low surface nitrate 
concentrations. Phytoplankton assemblages, production rates and biomass were 
dominated by small flagellated cells (<5 µm) until late July, yet increases in temperature 
and nitrate later in the season enabled larger Chaetoceros spp. diatoms to bloom. The 
Chaetoceros bloom coincided with a peak in silica production (0.429 µmol Si L-1 d-1), 
which was otherwise low, but variable. The time series was divided into three phases 
based on changes in environmental conditions, these phases were used to evaluate 
changes in biological dynamics. Phase I was characterised by sea-ice, low nitrate and 
increasing phytoplankton biomass and primary production. Phase II was a transitional 
period, with calm water conditions a drop in phytoplankton biomass, however, an 
increase in the mean nitrate concentration enabled more consistent carbon fixation. PIII 
had greater environmental variability driven by mixing events. The mixing of the water

iv 
column in PIII enabled larger Chaetoceors spp. to become prevalent in the surface waters 
contributing increasingly to the biomass and carbon utilisation. Overall, the nutrient 
concentrations, levels of biomass and production rates in Cambridge Bay were more 
reflective of those from oligotrophic regions. 
When comparing experimental data with observations made by the ONC observatory, a 
strong relationship between carbon utilisation and apparent oxygen utilisation became 
evident. This finding suggests that long-term in situ observations can potentially be used 
to monitor biological rates in the Arctic. The temporal resolution of this field study adds a 
seasonal perspective to our understanding of Arctic ecosystems, complements studies 
with greater spatial and interannual coverage, and can contribute to future numerical 
modelling of Arctic change. Furthermore, this study provides a first-time comparison 
between experimentally-measured phytoplankton production and cabled observations in 
the Arctic.

Acknowledgments 
First and foremost I express my upmost thanks to my supervisor, Dr. Diana Varela, 
whose support helped make this project a reality and success. Through this project I had 
the amazing opportunity to conduct field work in the Canadian Arctic and I have vastly 
developed my scientific skill set and experience. Without Diana’s support none of this 
would have been possible – so thank you! Funding was provided through NSERC funds 
to Dr. Diana Varela, a scholarship from The Canadian Memorial Foundation and UVic 
King-Platt Memorial and graduate awards. 
 
The field work logistics for this project were a particular challenge. Many essential 
connections were established with help from Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) staff, 
notably, Ryan Flagg and Akash Sastri. Further thanks is due to Akash for his ongoing 
support as a committee member and for his extensive help with the ONC data set. 
Likewise, my committee members, Kim Juniper and Rana El-Sabaawi, thank you for 
your support and feedback on my project planning and data interpretation.  
 
With that I must acknowledge my complete gratitude to the Polar Knowledge Canada 
(PKC) team based in Cambridge Bay, specifically Dwayne Beattie and Agulalik 
Pedersen. PKC hosted me in their Canadian High Arctic Research Station guest scientist 
accommodation, for the duration of my stay, but also assisted me in my daily sampling. 
Dwayne Beattie freely gave daily support to access the sample location (using PKC boat 
facilities), collect and recover samples from June through to August. Furthermore, use of 
the Northern Arctic College in Cambridge Bay, again accessed through PKC, was used 
throughout to do all my experimental work. Needless to say without their persistent and 
complete support in the field this project would not have been feasible! So thank you for 
not only helping to make it happen, but for welcoming and adopting me in to your team - 
making my time there a thoroughly enjoyable and successful experience!  
 
Much of my lab training came from previous (J. Long and C. Martin) and current 
students in the Varela Lab, their support has been quintessential! Karina Giesbrecht has 
graciously answered my hundred questions and has been a solid member of my support 
network throughout my M.Sc. For you, I have a wealth of respect, gratitude and a 
fantastic friend who has guided my navigation through grad-school!  
 
Thanks goes to my thesis writing group, my friends across the Atlantic pond, particularly 
Ribanna Dittrich (who I started my science journey with) and the new ones I have made 
through grad school - thank you for being there when you were most needed. 
Additionally the Stack-exchange community have been an incredible source of help for 
all my coding woes and the Lego-Grad Student community has been a source of 
comradery, dark humour and entertainment - which has kept me going on the bad days! 
 
As a final note I have to mention my amazing family who have supported me through the 
past seven years of my education, both emotionally and financially. They have listened to 
me through the highs and lows of grad school and chipped in to cover an uncountable 
number of my expenses! I most certainly would not be completing a Master of Science 
without all of your unconditional love and support.

Chapter 1 – General Introduction 
 
1.1 Arctic primary production 
The Arctic is a diverse oceanographic region, consisting of central deep ocean 
basins, e.g. the Canada and Amundsen Basins, and broad and narrow continental shelves, 
e.g. the Chukchi and Barents Seas (Stein and MacDonald, 2004). All these regions have 
their own complexities with a diverse range in oceanographic and ecological 
characteristics (Carmack and Wassman, 2006; Loeng et al., 2005). 
Historically, data collection in the Arctic Ocean has been largely restricted due to 
costs, accessibility and available technology, such that data remain sparse in a number of 
areas and over long time scales. Understanding long-term trends in this complex region is 
further complicated by the impact of climate change (CC), which is happening at a rate 
two to three times higher in the Arctic compared to the rest of the globe (Wassmann et 
al., 2011). In recent years, this pressing concern has driven large-scale initiatives, such as 
the International Polar Year (IPY) in 2007-2008, which included work from over 60 
different nations and thousands of scientists (www.ipy.org). Such initiatives have resulted 
in a number of intensive, spatially-broad studies that have vastly increased data available 
for the Arctic Ocean and marginal seas. Such studies have established a greater pan-
Arctic perspective on climate change, primary production, nutrient dynamics, biomass 
and phytoplankton assemblage in Arctic marine ecosystems (e.g. Wassmann et al., 2011; 
Varela et al. 2013; Codispoti et al., 2013; Hill et al., 2013; Wyatt et al., 2013; Crawford 
et al, 2015; Crawford et al, 2018). The IPY initiative resulted in many prominent 
findings, supporting and improving our predictions of CC in the Arctic Ocean and seas.

2 
Key observations include the decline in seasonal and multi-year sea-ice, duration of ice 
coverage, extent and thickness of sea ice (Sarmiento et al., 2004; Stroeve et al., 2012), 
which ultimately lead to longer open-water periods (Stroeve et al., 2014). Sea-ice decline 
appears to be associated to an increase in primary production (PP) (Arrigo et al. 2015). 
The dominant species, latitudinal distribution and boundaries of organisms are also 
expected to, and have been observed to, shift in response to CC driven environmental 
changes (Li et al., 2009; Grebmeier et al., 2006; Sarmineto et al., 2004) . 
The Bering and Chukchi Seas are annually the most productive regions of the 
Arctic (Table 1) assuming a 6-month growing period (e.g. Varela et al., 2013; Codispoti 
et al., 2013). In contrast, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) has comparatively 
lower values of PP (Varela et al., 2013; Codispoti et al., 2013; Carmack and Wassmann, 
2006). This difference is likely due to partial nutrient depletion of the water masses 
reaching the CAA (Varela et al., 2013; Tremblay et al., 2015). In contrast, the Beaufort, 
Kara, East Siberian and Laptev Seas are the least productive of the Arctic seas, 
particularly in their northernmost regions (Codispoti et al., 2013). The most notable 
difference in PP in the Arctic is between the oligotrophic Arctic basins and the 
surrounding coastal shelf regions (Table 1), where annual estimates of PP in the coastal 
regions can be orders of magnitude larger than in the basin and the central Arctic Ocean 
region (Table 1) and are estimated to contribute to the majority of annual PP in the Arctic 
(e.g Pabi et al., 2008). 
Alternative attempts to quantify PP in the Arctic Ocean have been via satellites 
and ocean colour (e.g. Arrigo et al., 2008; Pabi et al., 2008; Arrigo and van Dijken, 
2011). Estimates of annual PP in the Arctic are in the order of 513 Tg C y-1, with a

3 
reported increase of 23% from 1998-2006 (Arrigo et al., 2008). However, PP estimates 
from satellite data have recognised uncertainties, such as insufficient spatial resolution 
and the inability to penetrate though sea-ice and into the water column (Pabi et al., 2008), 
which can propagate errors in annual estimates. The limitation of satellites to penetrate 
ice-covered waters was emphasised with the discovery of massive under sea-ice 
phytoplankton blooms by Arrigo at al. (2012), which until recently were considered 
relatively negligible. Hence, the conclusions previously drawn about PP in the Arctic 
were challenged, particularly those derived from satellite data (Assmy et al., 2017). Such 
discoveries have pushed Arctic scientists to re-evaluate traditional methods and 
assumptions of Arctic PP, driving new research initiatives (e.g. Lowry et al., 2014). 
Much of the Arctic phytoplankton studies described above are based on data 
collected via research vessels and in vitro incubations, or is extrapolated from field data. 
Oceanographic sampling is inherently discontinuous, as samples are typically collected 
periodically along ship tracks, presenting only a snapshot view of one location at a 
specific moment in time. In addition, oceanographic studies can be further restricted in 
polar environments, due to the presence of sea-ice. This means that sampling is typically 
limited both in time and space, as cruises in polar waters often only take place later in the 
summer after sea-ice breakup. A recent synthesis of Arctic PP studies by Matrai et al. 
(2013) included data sets spanning >50 years. Matrai et al. (2013) found that the majority 
of in situ PP and Chlorophyll a measurements were collected in August and July, 
respectively, and further noted that samples are spread out over large sampling areas. 
This highlights that Arctic sampling is restricted both spatially and temporally,

which is problematic considering that intensive phytoplankton bloom events can start and 
reach completion in a period of days to weeks, with biomass able to vary 10-fold over the 
duration of a week (Sakshaug, 2004). As such, while transect sampling is conducive to a 
Pan-Arctic oceanographic perspective and expands our understanding of the Arctic’s 
diverse environments, this method may miss biological events, and under or overestimate 
the magnitude of biological production. Moreover, transect sampling is unlikely to be 
able to determine what environmental and chemical factors control Arctic phytoplankton 
bloom initiation and decline, production rates, biomass accumulation and species 
composition. As the role of phytoplankton in biogeochemical processes have been widely 
established (Emerson and Hedges, 2008; Houghton, 2007; Fowler et al., 2013; Lavelle et 
al., 2005; Tréguer and Rocha, 2013), any changes in the magnitude of PP or in the type 
of primary producers will impact the total export of carbon to deep waters. Subsequently, 
such changes will affect the global carbon cycle and may therefore impact the rate of 
climate change and the ecology of the marine system (Falowski et al., 1998). If the 
magnitude of PP and the presence of certain phytoplankton taxa are misrepresented, 
spatial and temporal extrapolations and model predictions will be poor representations of 
the real ocean. 
1.2 Overview of my thesis study 
In an effort to alleviate the shortage of temporal biological data sets in the Arctic, 
this study presents a seasonal high-resolution time-series from sea-ice coverage to open 
water conditions in an Arctic coastal Bay in 2016. Biological and chemical data were 
collected in situ from surface waters in Cambridge Bay (CB), Nunavut, and rate process

6 
experiments were conducted on site while oceanographic data was collected in situ by the 
Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) cabled observatory (Table 2, Figure 1.1) 
1.2.1 Study location 
The hamlet of Cambridge Bay is a small municipality on South-East of Victoria 
Island, Nunavut, in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. CB is a shallow estuarine bay 
(maximum depths of ~80 m) that has seasonal sea-ice coverage and connects to the 
neighbouring water masses in Dease Strait and Queen Maud Gulf in the North-West 
Passage. 
The ONC observatory was installed at 8 m depth in CB in 2012, and has been 
recording information since then. It hosts an array of instruments including, but not 
limited to: Conductivity Temperature and Depth (CTD), PAR and fluorometer sensors 
(for instrument specifications see Appendix C). The underwater platform is connected to 
shore by a fibre optic submarine cable, enabling data collected at 1-sec resolution to be 
wirelessly transmitted and accessible from the ONC website (www.oceannetworks.ca). 
The underwater observatory is paired with a meteorological station.

1.2.2 Research objectives and thesis structure 
The aim of my study was to broaden the understanding of seasonal mechanisms 
that control phytoplankton dynamics in Arctic surface waters. Here I link biological and 
chemical data collected in situ with oceanographic data from the ONC cabled observatory 
in the Arctic.  
Chapter 2 of this thesis presents seasonal phytoplankton dynamics from June 16 
to August 3, 2016 in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut. Additionally I present the seasonal 
changes in phytoplankton carbon and nitrate utilisation, silica production, biomass and 
taxonomy in relation to changes in the abiotic environment to determine what drives the 
measured changes in phytoplankton. Observed changes in environmental conditions 
during the sample period were broken down into time phases. Using the established time 
phases, I interpreted changes in phytoplankton dynamics in relation to the changes in 
environmental conditions in Cambridge Bay. 
In chapter 3, I explore the use of cabled observatory measurements as a proxy for 
monitoring phytoplankton dynamics at this location. I present a comparison between 
measured in vitro chlorophyll a and in vivo chlorophyll a fluorescence and discuss the 
use of fluorescence as a viable proxy for biomass in Arctic surface water. Furthermore, I 
compare carbon utilisation rates, measured in the field, with estimated biologically 
produced oxygen from ONC observatory data. Using the relationship between carbon 
utilisation rates and oxygen, I examined seasonal and interannual variability in biological 
carbon utilisation and variation in water temperature and sea-ice. 
Chapter 4 summarises the overall conclusions presented in this thesis. I also 
discuss the implications from this work and future research directions.

Chapter 2 –Phytoplankton Dynamics and Environmental Drivers 
During the Seasonal Arctic Melt-Down in a Shallow Arctic Bay 
 
2.1 Introduction 
The bottom-up controls of phytoplankton PP are nutrients and light availability 
(Codispoti et al., 2013; Tremblay et al., 2015). Light is often considered the primary 
controlling factor on Arctic systems due to its strong seasonal fluctuations (Leu et al., 
2015). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) available through the water column is 
further influenced by the presence of sea-ice and, moreover, by snow cover (Leu et al., 
2015; Stein and MacDonald, 2004; Campbell et al., 2016). Nutrient concentrations in 
Arctic surface waters, likewise, vary seasonally. The highest concentrations occur in the 
winter, when vertical stratification is weak, and no photosynthetic production can occur 
due to the lack of light. In spring (typically around April), waters begin to stratify as a 
result of increases in sea-ice melt, solar radiation and precipitation, and, in coastal 
regions, due to an increase in riverine inputs (Loeng et al., 2005; Mauritzen, 2012). The 
spring density stratification can initially promote PP in the upper water column (Loeng et 
al., 2005); however, persistent stratification can limit the nutrient resupply to the ocean 
surface. Phytoplankton production can then deplete surface nutrients to detection limits 
that effectively terminates the bloom (Leu et al., 2015). Recent seasonal studies have 
suggested that nitrate depletion in surface waters is the primary limiting factor for PP in 
the Arctic Ocean (Taylor et al., 2013; Tremblay et al., 2006; Tremblay et al., 2015). 
Grazing pressure acts as a top-down control on phytoplankton, regulating their standing 
stocks (Leham, 1991). Sheer et al., (2009) found average microzooplankton grazing rates 
on phytoplankton daily growth of around 22 ± 26% in the western Canadian Arctic.

11 
However, in the Barents Sea, Verity et al, (2002) reported a reduction of up to 97% of 
daily chlorophyll a production via grazing and suggested that grazing accounted for 2/3 
of the variation in chlorophyll a standing stock. Zooplankton production and life cycles 
have been found to be tightly coupled to the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom in 
the Arctic (Søreide et al., 2010). 
Processes dictating nutrient and light availability in the Arctic effectively leave a 
limited time frame in which annual production can occur in order to sustain the Arctic 
ecosystem (Leu et al., 2015; Tremblay et al., 2006; Sakshaug, 2004). The onset of ice-
algae production pinpoints the transition from winter to spring, with phytoplankton 
beginning to bloom when sea-ice melt has commenced, however, blooms have been 
observed while there was sea-ice coverage (Assmy et al., 2017; Arrigo et al., 2012). Poor 
data availability limits quantifiable estimates of ice and under ice production (Leu et al., 
2015). In response to seasonal changes in light, nutrients and other growth-mediating 
factors, phytoplankton PP rates can shift rapidly (Tremblay et al., 2015; Tremblay et al., 
2011).  
New production by phytoplankton is the primary production solely driven by the 
utilisation of nitrate, whereas regenerated production is that portion of PP which results 
from using recycled forms of N, such as ammonium (Dugdale et al., 1992) and urea 
(Varela and Harrison, 1999). The ratio of new production to total production is referred to 
as the f ratio (Eppley and Peterson, 1979). Availability of the different forms of N is 
thought to influence the types of taxa and amount of production that can occur (Ardyna et 
al., 2017). Phytoplankton growth strategies and seasonal succession impact nutrient 
cycling and energy transfer through trophic levels (Ardyna et al.,2011; Tremblay et al

12 
2009); however, limited fine-scale observations within the Arctic restrict our conclusions 
and predictions of such processes. 
Broad-scale common phytoplankton taxa within the Arctic and Subarctic Seas are 
diatoms (Bacillariophyceae), dinoflagellates (Dinophyceae), crytomonads 
(Cryptophycae), chrysophytes (Chrysophyceae), prymnesiophytes (Prymnesiophyceae), 
euglenids (Euglenida) and choanoflagellate (Choanomonada)  (Poulin et al., 2011; 
Crawford et al., 2018). The majority of these phytoplankton are in the nanoplankton size-
range (5-20 !m), however, diatoms and dinoflagellates are often abundant in certain 
regions and are in the microplankton (>20 !m) category (Poulin et al., 2011).  
Large diatoms in particular are considered an important taxa for food webs and 
biogeochemical cycling on a global scale and comprise >50% of identified species of 
Arctic and Subarctic phytoplankton (e.g. Laney and Sosik, 2014). Among diatoms, 
centric forms such as Chaetoceros spp., Thalassiosira spp. and the pennate Cylindrotheca 
spp. are thought to be ubiquitous in distribution (Poulin et al., 2011). What is not clear is 
how the specific genera or species contributes to production and biomass in the 
phytoplankton assemblage.  
Picoplankton (<2 !m), originally described by Sakshaug (2004) as being 
important only within the southern fringes of the Subarctic (such as the Bering Sea), have 
now been suggested to be important within the Canada Basin (Li et al., 2009; Crawford 
et al. 2018) and in oligotrophic conditions. Yet Arctic marine phytoplankton are often 
described in terms of biomass, which is dominated by the microplanktonic species (Leu 
et al., 2015). Moreover, many methods historically favoured the documentation of 
microplankton, as discussed by Crawford et al., 2018. More recent genomic approaches

13 
are finding greater diversity in the nano and pico size-ranges than previously documented 
in the Arctic (e.g. Comeau et al., 2013; Leu et al., 2015). On a longer timescale, smaller 
flagellated cells have been observed to be more successful as environmental conditions 
shift with changes in sea-ice and circulation (Li et al., 2009), but few studies have looked  
at the seasonal transition of phytoplankton assemblages in the Arctic. 
While such studies have advanced our understanding of the multifaceted drivers 
of PP rates, biomass, nutrient concentration and phytoplankton assemblages in the Arctic, 
there still remains gaps in our knowledge. Seasonal time-series, phytoplankton dynamics 
and moreover taxonomic assemblage data remain limited and unresolved in Arctic 
ecosystems (Laney and Sosik, 2014; Leu et al., 2015; Crawford et al., 2018). Sakshaug 
(2004) deemed fine-meshed spatial and temporal measurements to be necessary for 
accurate PP estimates. Hence, intensive studies with a high temporal resolution of 
sampling will aid in the understanding of Arctic PP and nutrient dynamics. 
 
 
This project aims to improve our understanding of phytoplankton bloom 
progression and the associated abiotic dynamics over the seasonal sea-ice breakup in a 
coastal Arctic location (Cambridge Bay, Victoria Island) in the Canadian Arctic 
Archipelago (CAA, Figure 1.1). Cambridge Bay is shallow, with maximum depths of ~80 
m (although the majority is shallower). It is seasonally covered by sea ice from 
approximately October to early July and experiences both the polar day and night. Here I 
present a temporal study from 2016 of phytoplankton production rates, biomass and taxa 
contributions alongside nutrient and environmental dynamics. I used stable-isotope and 
fluorescent tracer incubations to measure phytoplankton PP and biogenic silica

14 
production, extracted chlorophyll a and biogenic silica to measure phytoplankton 
biomass, and taxonomic analysis to determine the composition of the phytoplankton 
assemblages. The objective was to understand what factors drive seasonal changes, from 
spring to summer, of phytoplankton in the coastal Arctic. To determine this, I compared 
the measured changes in phytoplankton growth, biomass and composition to nutrient 
concentrations and oceanographic conditions measured by the ONC observatory.  
2.2 Sampling and Methods: 
2.2.1 Sampling location and dates: 
 
During the summer of 2016, seawater samples were collected from the ocean 
surface (5 m) in close proximity to the Ocean Networks Canada’s (ONC) cabled 
Observatory (Figure 1.1) in Cambridge Bay (CB), Victoria Island, Nunavut, Canada. 
Sampling was conducted daily from June 16 to July 15, after which it was performed 
every-other day until August 3, totalling 37 sampling events (events = days). The only 
exceptions were on July 2 and 3 when sampling was not possible due to unstable sea ice 
and poor weather conditions, and July 22 and 23 when the sampling boat was 
unavailable.  
 
From June 16 to June 30, water samples were collected through a hole in the 
sea ice at about 10 m from the ONC observatory. On July 1, on the day of sea-ice break 
up, a morning shift in sea ice restricted access to the sampling site, and seawater was 
sampled between ~20-50 m from the observatory. From July 4 and onwards, open water 
conditions prevailed and sampling occurred again within ~10 m of the ONC cabled 
observatory.

15 
2.2.2 Seawater sampling and incubation experiments: 
 
Every day at the same time, a 5-L Niskin bottle was cast multiple times to 
collect enough seawater for all measurements. Seawater from the various Niskin casts 
was used to rinse and fill acid-washed 1-L and 0.5-L polycarbonate (PC) bottles for 
productivity experiments: 13C and 15N utilisation rates (rC and rNO3-) and silica 
production (rSi). Additional seawater samples were homogenized in an acid-washed 10-
L low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic carboy and used for the following 
measurements: phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a, (Chl a)), biogenic silica (bSiO2), 
dissolved macro-nutrients (nitrate (NO3-), phosphate (PO43-) and silicic acid (Si(OH)4), 
referred to henceforth as “nutrients” or “dissolved nutrients”), and phytoplankton 
taxonomic identification. Aliquots were distributed and inoculated on site for incubation 
experiments (section 2.2.5), whereas, the rest of the seawater in the carboy was 
transported in an insulated case (“cooler”) to the land-based laboratory in the Arctic 
College, CB, for further processing. 
2.2.3 Oceanographic and meteorological measurements  
 
Oceanographic parameters were continuously measured every second by the 
ONC cabled observatory. These parameters included: conductivity, temperature and 
depth (CTD), sea-ice (draft) thickness (ID), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), 
oxygen (O2), and chlorophyll fluorescence (Chl a fl.). See Appendix C for instrument 
details. At the same time, incident irradiance (IR), air temperature and local wind were 
continuously logged every second by a meteorological station located onshore at the CB 
dock (Appendix C). Data were downloaded as binned 1-min averages from the ONC data

16 
archive (https://data.oceannetworks.ca) and daily averages were calculated for each 
parameter for further analyses in this study.  
2.2.4 Dissolved Nutrients  
 
Seawater samples for dissolved nutrients (NO3-, Si(OH)4 and PO43-) were 
filtered through disposable 0.45 µm sterile polyethersulfone filters (VWR) into acid-
washed 15-ml centrifuge tubes. All samples were immediately frozen at -20 °C until 
analysis at the University of Victoria (UVic) in the Astoria 2 Nutrient Autoanalyzer as 
per Barwell-Clarke and Whitney (1996). Note that the NO3- value represents the 
concentration of both NO3-  + NO2-, however, NO2- is considered a minor contributor to 
NO3-  + NO2-. 
2.2.5. Phytoplankton Biomass: 
 
Seawater samples (500 ml) were filtered through 0.7 µm glass-fibre filters 
(GF/F), 25 mm in diameter, to determine total phytoplankton biomass (TChl a). 
Additionally, seawater (500 ml) were filtered in cascade through 20 µm and 5 µm pore-
size PC filters, and further through 0.7 µm GF/F filters to determine the relative 
contribution of different size fractions (>20 µm, 5-20 µm and 0.7-5 µm) to the total 
phytoplankton biomass (TChl a). After filtration, filters were stored at -20°C in sealed 
foil packages until fluorometric analysis were conducted at UVic. Chl a was extracted 
over 24 h using 90% acetone, and phaeopigments were assessed by acidification 
following the procedure in Parsons et al. (1984). Fluorescence was measured using a pre-
calibrated Turner Designs 10AU field fluorometer. 
 
Biogenic silica (bSiO2) concentrations were measured by filtering 1 L of 
seawater through 0.65 µm pore-size PC filters. Filters were dried at ~60 ˚C for 48 h,

17 
stored in foil packages within a sealed bag containing silicon desiccant for later 
processing at UVic. Samples were analysed via the Brzezinski and Nelson (1986) method 
using a Beckmann DU 530 UV/Vis spectrophotometer after bSiO2 was converted into 
Si(OH)4 by alkaline hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (Brzezinski and Nelson, 
1989).  
2.2.6 Productivity experiments 
 
Productivity experiments commenced on June 17 through to August 3, 2016. 
Samples were incubated in situ at 5 m depth using a customised array (Figure 2.1) that 
allowed samples to be exposed to ambient temperature and light conditions. All 
experiments started typically between 9:00 to 10:00 AM (MDT [UTC-6]) at the sampling 
location and were incubated in situ for ~24 h. After the incubation time, samples were 
retrieved and transported back to the Arctic College laboratory, where they were 
terminated by gentle filtration using appropriate filters and dried at ~60°C for 48 h before 
being stored for further analysis.

18 
 
2.2.7 Carbon and Nitrogen Utilisation Rates: 
 
A dual tracer method was used to measure carbon (13C ) and nitrate (15N ) 
utilisation rates (rC and rNO3-, respectively). Sample bottles were filled with seawater 
and immediately inoculated on site with 13C-labelled NaHCO3 (99 atom % purity 13C, 
Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories) and 15N-labelled NaNO3 (98 atom % purity 15N, 
Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) to determine rC and rNO3-, respectively. The 
enrichment target for both 13C and 15N was <10% of the total ambient dissolved inorganic 
carbon (DIC) and NO3- concentrations, respectively. Additions were based on average 
DIC values from the Coronation Gulf (~1530 µmol kg-1; Dr. Brent Else, personal 
communication) and at the concentration of the detection limit of NO3-. Final additions

were 150 µmol L-1 13C and 0.1 µmol L-1 15NO3-. A caveat of this method is that under 
conditions of limiting nutrients, the 15NO3- addition can exceed the target enrichment of 
10% of ambient NO3- concentrations (Dugdale and Goering, 1967). Nevertheless, this 
still enabled us to draw conclusions about maximum potential utilisation rates of NO3- in 
this region. 
 
Post incubation, samples were filtered through 0.7 µm combusted GF/F and 
dried at 60°C for at least 48 h. Samples were prepared at the UVic for further analysis at 
the Stable Isotope Facility at the University of California Davis (UC Davis). At UC 
Davis, the isotopic composition (12C:13C and the 14N:15N) and the total C and N 
concentrations were measured with a PDZ Europa 20-20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer 
(Sercon Ltd., Cheshire, UK) interfaced with an Elemental Micro Cube elemental analyser 
(Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Hanau, Germany). Samples for isotopic and 
particulate C and N measurements were not acidified prior to analysis, thus results does 
not only include particulate organic matter (POM) but could also include suspended 
particulate inorganic carbon (i.e. carbonate), which in turn may overestimate the 
particulate organic carbon, and the carbon to nitrogen particulate ratios (POC:PON) 
(Crawford et al., 2015). As our values may include an inorganic fraction, we refer to 
them as PC and PN. 
 
From June 17 until July 6, three additional seawater samples (1 L) were 
inoculated, incubated and filtered serially through 5 µm PC and 0.7 µm combusted glass 
fibre filters, to compare the C and N utilisation by small (<5 µm) phytoplankton cells 
(size fractionated) with those of the entire assemblage. Post July 6 only three 1L bottles

20 
were incubated which were split into two aliquots to measure total and size-fractionated 
utilisation rates. 
 
During the study period, blanks and dark incubations were periodically conducted 
(9 darks and 5 blanks in total). Blanks were filtered immediately after isotopic 
inoculation, while the dark bottles were incubated exactly as the other samples but with 
no light penetration (i.e. PC bottles covered with black tape). The blank verifies whether 
any 13C is adsorbed to the outside of the cells, and checks for the isotopic background 
level. The dark bottle assesses carbon fixation with no light present. Carbon fixation in 
the dark was  negligible and the residual isotopic background was  at natural levels. 
Carbon utilisation rates (rC or PP) were calculated following Hama et al. (1983), while 
NO3- uptake rates (rNO3-) were calculated following Dugdale and Wilkerson (1986). 
2.2.8 Silica Production 
 
Biogenic silica production was assessed in two different ways. In the first 
method, seawater samples (400 ml) were spiked with 50 µL of the fluorescent tracer 
PDMPO (Lysosensor DND-160 from Life Technologies) with a final concentration of 
PDMPO in the incubation bottle of 125 nmol L-1 (Leblanc and Hutchins, 2005; McNair et 
al., 2015; Long, 2015). After the 24-h incubation period, the sample was split into two: 
(a) 200 ml were used to fluorometrically determine the ‘bulk’ phytoplankton assemblage 
silica production (rSi) determined through PDMPO incorporation, and (b) 200 ml were 
used to discern the taxonomic contribution to total PDMPO incorporation and thus taxon-
specific silica production via microscopy.  
 
A second method was used to assess the accumulation of bSiO2 throughout 
the sampling period. Seawater was incubated in 1-L PC acid-washed bottles without any

21 
additions, and filtered through 0.65 µm PC filters after a 24-h incubation period. Filters 
were dried at 60°C for at least 48 h and digested as for bSiO2 in section 2.2.5. The net 
accumulation of bSiO2 over the incubation period was calculated as the difference 
between the bSiO2 after and before (ambient) incubation. These experiments were done 
less regularly (n =16 as opposed to n = 37 for the other measurements). 
2.2.8 (a) Bulk silica production: 
 
An aliquot of the incubated sample (200 ml) was gently filtered through a 
0.65 µm PC filter. Cells were lysed as the filtration neared completion by soaking the 
filter with 10% HCl for 2 min. The filters were then rinsed with distilled water to get rid 
of any unbound PDMPO (Long, 2015). Filters were dried at ~60°C for 24 h and stored in 
foil pouches until future analysis. 
 
Back at the UVic laboratory, filters were transferred to 15-ml centrifuge tubes 
and exposed to 2 ml of 0.5 mol L-1 of hydrofluoric acid (HF) for 3 h to dissolve the bSiO2 
and bound PDMP (McNair et al. 2015 and Long, 2015). After the HF digestion period, 
4.8 ml of saturated boric acid was added and samples were vortexed. The PDMPO 
fluorescence was measured using a Turner Trilogy fluorometer with a crude oil module 
(380/80 nm excitation and 410-600 nm emission) on the UV setting (McNair et al. 2015 
and Long, 2015). A standard fluorescent curve was made using the same matrix of HF-
saturated boric acid used for the samples, with additions of known concentrations of 
PDMPO. The PDMPO incorporation (nmol L-1) by phytoplankton assemblages were then 
calculated using the standard curve, and converted into a biogenic silica production rate 
(rSi [µmol Si L-1 d-1]) using a linear relationship of Si to PDMPO incorporation 
(Si:PDMPO).

22 
 
The Si:PDMPO ratio has been reported to be affected by the ambient 
concentration of Si(OH)4, whereby a linear decrease in ratio between rSi and PDMPO 
occurred when Si(OH)4 was lower than 3 µmol L-1 (McNair et al., 2015). In this study, I 
used a Si:PDMPO incorporation ratio of 2916 ± 708:1 (mol:mol) from McNair et al., 
(2015), as concentrations of Si(OH)4 were always between 3 and 5 µmol L-1. For 
comparison, I also used the Si:PDMPO incorporation ratio of 4200 ± 380:1 (mol:mol) 
(Long, 2015), although this ratio was suggested to be better suited for Si(OH)4 
concentrations >5 µmol L-1.  
2.2.8 (b) Taxonomic Contributions to Silica Production: 
 
To assess the PDMPO incorporation by individual cells, the amount of 
fluorescence from each cell was measured and cells were identified to genus level, when 
possible. This enabled the quantification of the relative contribution of each genus to total 
rSi. 
 
After the 24-h incubation period, various volumes of sample (5, 25, 50 and 
100 ml) were filtered through 0.6 µm PC filters using low vacuum pressure with the aim 
of obtaining optimum cellular density and structural preservation (Long, 2015). The cells 
were then mounted onto glass microscope slides via a freeze-transfer method (Long, 
2015; McNair et al., 2015). Slides were dried in the dark, at room temperature, after 
which Shandon Immu-mount (Thermo Scientific) was applied, and filters were covered 
with coverslips and stored in the dark at 4°C prior to imaging at UVic. 
 
An Olympus IX-70 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 10x (0.25 
NA) objective, DAPI excitation filter (377/50 nm) and custom emission filter (510/140 
nm) was used for imaging analysis of the PDMPO stained cells. Images were captured

23 
using a 12-bit Retiga QImaging camera coupled to µManager and ImageJ software 
(Long, 2015; Edelstein et al., 2010; Rasband 2012). Time constraints dictated the number 
of samples (n = 10) that were analysed for taxonomic contributions to rSi. Selected 
samples matched the dates selected for phytoplankton taxonomy analysis (sections 2.2.9) 
and the times when silica biomass was higher. For each sample slide imaged, 30 images 
(fields of view, FOV) were captured, along with bright field images for reference. 
Exposure time of the images in this study were generally set at 3000 ms, although at 
times this was reduced if pixels were over saturated as per Long (2015).  
 
Prior to imaging the sample slides, a yellow fluorescent calibration slide was 
also imaged (randomly in 10 selected locations on the slide) to correct for the unevenness 
of illumination across the field of view. The fluorescence from the 10 images, with 
maximum intensity adjusted through manual focusing, were combined and averaged to 
produce one calibration image using Image J software following Long (2015). Of each 
imaged sample (slide), randomly selected FOV were analysed in ImageJ software. This 
analysis yielded the total particle fluorescence intensity, which is proportional to the 
PDMPO incorporated by a cell. A binary mask was created with a corresponding map of 
particles enabling the fluorescent intensities of particles to be assigned to identified 
diatom cells to quantify cell PDMPO fluorescence, as described in depth by Long (2015). 
The aim was to obtain a cumulative fluorescence average from the dominant species that 
had a relative standard deviation <15%; images were analysed until this criterion was met 
for each sample. However, in the cases where diatom abundance was exceedingly low, it 
was impossible to reach this criterion and in those cases ³3 images were analysed (Long, 
2015).

24 
2.2.9 Phytoplankton taxonomy: 
 
Samples for phytoplankton taxa identification and enumeration were 
collected in 125 ml high-density amber polyethylene bottles, and preserved with acidic 
Lugols’ iodine solution (Parsons et al. 1984). Samples were stored at room temperature 
in the dark prior to enumeration. Due to the time consuming nature of manual taxa 
identification, the number of samples that could be analysed for this study was 
constrained to 15. To cover the duration of the sampling period, I analysed samples 
obtained every 4 days. However, I also analysed additional samples collected during 
peaks in TChl a and rC. 
 
Phytoplankton identification was performed using an inverted Olympus IX-70 
epifluorescence microscope. Whenever possible cells were identified to species level, 
however, for the majority of cells, identification was made to genus level. The 
taxonomical classifications were used within the statistical analysis of the phytoplankton 
assemblage described in 2.2.10. The total abundance of cells per litre was calculated, 
which was broken down into the percentage of diatoms (Bacillariophyceae), 
dinoflagellates (Dinophyceae), chrysophytes (Chrysophyceae), silicoflagellates 
(Dictyochophyceae), flagellates (<7 µm), and unidentifiable (unknown) phytoplankton 
cells. Diatoms were presented to genus level and in some cases, a morphological or ‘type’ 
category was assigned; for example, unknown and rare (< 3 cells counted per sample) 
diatoms were grouped morphologically as ‘other pennates’ and ‘other centrics’, or when 
the morphological category was not clear, the term ‘other diatoms’ was used. Due to low 
cell abundance, a minimum of 40 FOV or 200 cells (whichever was reached first) were 
counted using a 40X objective. Taxonomic reference literature was primarily used to help

25 
with identification (Horner, 2002; Spaulding et al., 2010, Tomas, 1997; Ardyna et al., 
2011; Crawford et al,. 2018) along with further advice from Dr. Adrián Cefarelli from 
Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, Comodoro Rivadavia, 
Argentina.  
2.2.10 Data analysis 
 
Data manipulation, analysis and graphing were conducted primarily in R 
using several packages: plyr (Wickham, 2011); dplyr (Wickham and Francois, 2015); 
reshape2 (Wickham, 2007); Prophet (Taylor and Letham, 2017); ggplot2 (Wickham, 
2009); gridExtra (Auguie, 2016)); grid (R-Core Team, 2013, among other R-Core Team 
packages. An exception was for the phytoplankton assemblage analysis that was done 
using Primer software (discussed below). All reported errors in the figures and text are 
standard error around the mean. 
 
Data were divided into three phases: Phase one (PI) from June 16 to July 1, 
phase two (PII) from July 2 to 13, and phase three (PIII) from July 14 to August 3. The 
relationships between measured variables (e.g. sea-ice thickness and rC) through the 
time phases were analysed using Pearson’s product-moment correlation (r), whereby the 
linearity between variables was assessed to a significance of at least 95% confidence (p £ 
0.05). Pearson’s r was additionally calculated to assess the existence of linear correlations 
between variables in the three time phases. The correlations were an attempt to assess 
whether environmental variables (e.g. nutrients) could be identified as drivers of 
biological change. Time phases cannot be considered statistically independent due to 
auto-correlation, whereby each day is dependent on the previous day, thus violating 
assumptions required to conduct further tests (e.g. Student’s t-test). Therefore, the phases

26 
in time used in this study should not be considered statistically significantly different 
from each other, but rather are discussed in a descriptive context and correlated to the 
observed changes in the biological data. 
To investigate the environmental drivers of changes in phytoplankton 
composition over time in CB, phytoplankton assemblage data were analysed using a 
multivariate method available in the statistical software package PRIMER 6 (Clarke and 
Gorley, 2006) with the add-on package of PERMANOVA+ (Anderson et al., 2008). Rare 
phytoplankton were eliminated, as this improved the dissimilarity matrix index by 
avoiding sample grouping primarily on the joint occurrence of rare random cells (Field et 
al., 1982). This was achieved by reducing the data to identified species/genus that 
contributed ³3% to at least one of the samples analysed (Clarke and Warwick, 2001; 
Field et al., 1982), enabling a clearer interpretation of the subsequent cluster analysis 
(discussed below). The remainder species/genus were then fourth-root transformed prior 
to analysis. Such transformations enabled all species to contribute to the definition of 
similarity, while preserving information on the abundance distribution, following 
recommendations by Clarke and Warwick (2001). To assess these differences between 
phytoplankton assemblage samples, I used a Bray-Curtis similarity or resemblance matrix 
(Bray and Curtis, 1957).  
Hierarchical cluster analysis (CLUSTER) of the resemblance matrix was 
performed with group-averaged linkage, to visualise the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix , 
as a dendrogram. To assess the structure of the abundance sample groupings within the 
dendrogram, a SIMPROF test was applied. A SIMPROF test determines whether the

27 
dendrogram groupings are significantly (p <0.05) different from one another (Clarke and 
Warwick, 2001). 
To explore whether measured environmental variables could explain the 
significant variation in the cluster groupings of phytoplankton assemblages, a distance 
based linear model (DISTLM) was applied (Anderson et al., 2008). A DISLTM models 
the relationship of one or more predictor variables (environmental data) to multivariate 
data (abundance dissimilarity matrix) following a distance-based regression (Anderson et 
al., 2008). In layman’s terms, a DISTLM measures the dissimilarity between samples in 
the species abundance matrix and best matches those dissimilarities to measured 
distances in the environmental matrix. As such, it can identify which measured distances 
of individual and multiple environmental variables between samples best match the 
differences in the abundance samples.  
Prior to the DISTLM, correlation plots were produced to assess the relationship 
between the environmental variables and whether there was any deviation from a normal 
distribution (i.e. left or right skew) of the individual environmental variables. The 
Pearson’s correlation of all measured environmental variables was below the suggested 
cut off of 0.95 (Anderson et al., 2008). A maximum correlation (r) of 0.88 was found in 
my data; hence, all 9 environmental variables were kept for further analysis. Ice thickness 
(m) and NO3- concentration (µmol L-1) data were not normally distributed (right skewed), 
thus a log transformation was applied. Furthermore, sea-ice thickness data had a high 
number of zero values, such that an amendment to the log function was necessary: 
log(x+1)). The salinity and oxygen were both left skewed, so a reverse log was applied 
(log(c-x), where c is larger than the maximum value), following methods proposed by

28 
Clarke and Gorley (2006). The transformations reduced the apparent skewedness, 
although ice thickness still remained apparently right skewed. After transformation, the 
environmental variables were normalised (to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1).  
The DISTLM used individual environmental variables with BEST selection 
procedure and 999 permutations to produce the most parsimonious model (Anderson et 
al, 2008). The BEST procedure uses all possible combinations of predictor variables with 
the Akaike selection criterion (AIC) due to is predisposition to the simplest model in 
terms of the number of predictor variables included. To discern the relationship of 
individual environmental variables to the phytoplankton assemblage dissimilarity matrix, 
a marginal test was performed (Anderson et al., 2008). 
A distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) plot (constrained ordination plot) 
was applied to visualise the DISTLM in a 2D format. Samples in the dbRDA plot are 
identified both by their sample date and the SIMPROF grouping (associated symbol) with 
vectors proportional to the BEST model selected environmental variables and their 
contribution to total variation. 
2.3 Results 
2.3.1 Definition of Environmental phases: 
The sampling season in 2016 in CB was divided into three distinct phases 
delimited by changes in daily average ocean and atmospheric environmental conditions, 
measured by the ONC underwater sensors (Figure 2.2 A-F) and at the shore station 
(Figure 2.2 G-I). These phases spanned from the initial sampling date on the June 16 to 
July 1, July 2 to 13, and July 14 to August 3, referred to as phase I (PI), phase II (PII) and

29 
phase III (PIII), respectively (Table 3), and indicated by the dashed lines in Figures 2.2 – 
2.6. 
Phase I was characterised by a significant linear decline in sea-ice thickness from >1.2 m 
thick to the break point on July 1 (Figure 2.2 A, Table 3). Salinity had a strong linear 
decline and was, on average, 28.8 ± 0.042 (Figure 2.2 B, Table 3). In contrast, seawater 
temperature, PAR and O2 concentration increased significantly, and averaged -0.355 ± 
0.075°C, 41.3 ± 4.75 µE m2 s-1 and 8.57 ± 0.030 ml L-1, respectively (Figure 2.2 C-E, 
Table 3). In vivo Chl a fl. significantly increased, although with greater variability than 
observed in the other ONC variables in PI (0.464 ± 0.016 µg L-1, Figure 2.2 F, Table 3). 
Incoming solar radiation was on average 230 ± 96 W m2, and air temperature averaged 
6.52 ± 2.53°C (Figure 2.2 D-E, Table 3), both increased significantly in PI. The wind 
speed (Figure 2.2 H, Table 3) was variable (3.46 ± 1.68 m s-1) during PI.

After the major break of sea-ice on July 1, PII started. A few thin sea-ice pancakes 
remained for ~2 days, moving around the surface in the bay (Marshall personal 
observation), however, the ice-pancakes quickly melted and ice remained absent for the 
remaining sampling period i.e. 0 m (Figure 2.2 A, Table 3). The surface water column 
stabilised during PII, whereby, the salinity (Figure 2.2 B, Table 3) became relatively 
constant (28.6 ± 0.01 PSU). However, temperatures continued to increase significantly 
(water temperature mean: 0.515 ± 0.05°C, air temperature mean: 12.8 ± 1.18 °C, Figure 
2.2 C and G, respectively, and Table 3). Likewise, PAR continued to strongly increase 
(mean: 136 ± 9.30 µE m2 s-1, Figure 2.2 D, Table 3) in PII, whereas, O2 became relatively 
constant (mean: 8.76 ± 0.01 ml L-1, Figure 2.2 E, Table 3). The Chl a fl. declined linearly 
(mean: 0.293 ± 0.033 µg L-1, Figure 2.2 F, Table 3). During PII, IR was higher (314 ± 14 
W m2) than in PI (Figure 2.2 G, Table 3) and wind speed (Figure 2.2 I, Table 3) reached 
its lowest daily average (1.4 m s-1) on July 9. Mean wind speed (3.34 ± 0.40 m s-1) was 
only slightly lower (Table 3), but less variable than in PI.  
Environmental conditions in phase III contrasted with those in phases I and II. 
Phase III showed greater variability with no strong linear trends in environmental 
variables through time (Figure 2.2, Table 3). Sea-ice was absent (Figure 2.2 A). 
Early in PIII (July 14-16) a spike in salinity was observed alongside a drop in 
water temperatures, deviating from the previously observed strong linear increase (Figure 
2.2 B-C, Table 3). However, over PIII the increasing trend in water temperature persisted, 
albeit with greater variation (Table 3), leading to a further increase in the mean water 
temperature (1.87 ± 0.21°C). Wind speed (Figure 2.2 I) reached a maximum phase mean 
(4.94 ± 0.30 m s-1). On both July 14 and 15 wind speeds exceeded 16 m s-1, resulting in

the maximum daily average wind speed under ice-free conditions on July 15. After July 
15, wind speeds remained variable, but showed a declining pattern over the course of PIII 
(r = -0.67, p <0.01). All of the remaining oceanographic and atmospheric mean 
conditions declined slightly in PIII, however with no significant linearity (Table 3). 
2.3.2 Dissolved Nutrient Regime  
Over the entire sampling period, NO3- concentrations varied one order of 
magnitude (Figure 2.3 A-C, Table 3) averaging 0.674 ± 0.078 µmol L-1, whereas Si(OH)4 
and PO43 were relatively stable (mean = 3.83 ± 0.040 µmol L-1 and 0.681 ± 0.004 µmol 
PO43-, L-1, respectively). The average NO3-:PO43- ratio (mol:mol) was 1.00 ± 0.36, 
whereas the Si(OH)4: NO3- (mol:mol) was on average 9.98 ± 4.17 (Appendix B). 
During PI, NO3- (Figure 2.3 A) and Si(OH)4 (Figure 2.3 B) concentrations had no clear 
trend (Table 3). Nitrate was at its lowest average concentration of the sampling period in 
PI (0.37 ± 0.066 µmol L-1), however, a NO3- increased (~2.5 fold) at the end of PI on 
June 30. Silicic acid was relatively constant (3.93 ± 0.024 µmol L-1); whereas, PO43- 
concentration (Figure 2.3 C) decreased linearly throughout PI (r = -0.70, p <0.01), 
although, the variation in PO43- was relatively low (0.685 ± 0.005 µmol L-1). 
During PII, NO3- concentrations (Figure 2.3 A, Table 3) were greater than those in 
PI (mean = 1.07 ± 0.072 µmol L-1). Contrastingly, both Si(OH)4 and PO43- concentrations 
(Figure 2.3 B and C, respectively) were on average lower (mean = 3.72 ± 0.078 µmol L-1 
and 0.67 ± 0.006 µmol L-1, respectively) than in PI (Table 3).  
 
During PIII, greater variability was measured in NO3- (mean = 0.757 ± 0.177 
µmol L-1, Table 3), with overall maximum NO3- (Figure 2.3 A) found between July14-15

(2.01 and 1.43 µmol L-1, respectively). Silicic acid concentrations significantly declined 
in PIII (r = -0.68 p <0.05) with a mean of 3.79 ± 0.100 µmol L-1 (Figure 2.3 B, Table 3). 
PO43- concentrations (Figure 2.3 C, Table 3) had a slightly higher mean and variation 
than in the prior phases (0.69 ± 0.008 µmol L-1), however, similarly to NO3-, PO43- 
concentrations were variable during PIII. 
2.3.3 Biomass and Primary Productivity 
2.3.3. (a) Phytoplankton and diatom biomass, and particulate C and N 
Over the entire sampling period, in vivo TChl a  (Figure 2.4 A) averaged 0.112 ± 
0.005 µg L-1. Most of the TChl a was attributed to ‘small’ cells (0.7-5 µm, Figure 2.4 B, 
Table 3). On average, these small cells accounted for 82 ± 2% of TChl a, while the 
‘large’ cells (>20 µm) represented 10 ± 2% of TChl a. The ‘medium’ sized 
phytoplankton cells (5-20 µm) contributed the least to TChl a (7 ± 0.7%). Biogenic silica 
(Figure 2.4 C) was variable (mean = 0.306 + 0.026 µmol L-1) over the sampling duration 
Particulate C (PC) and N (PN) averaged 14.9 ± 0.427 µmol L-1 (Figure 2.4 D) and 1.60 ± 
0.058 µmol L-1 (Figure 2.4 E), respectively, and the PC:PN ratio averaged 9.66 ± 0.297 
(Figure 2.4 F) over the sampling period.  
In PI, TChl a was on average 0.118 ± 0.010 µg L-1 and it reached a maximum 
concentration (0.217 ± 0.021 µg L-1) on July 1 (Figure 2.4 A, Table 3). The biomass 
contribution of small phytoplankton cells (0.7-5 µm) significantly increased in PI (Table 
3), to reach a maximum at 89% on July 1 when there was a peak in TChl a (Figure 2.4 
B). The biomass of siliceous plankton (bSiO2) was low in PI, but variable (mean = 0.284 
± 0.021 µmol L-1) with no obvious trends (Figure 2.4 C, Table 3). On average PC and PN 
were 12.9 ± 0.473 µmol C L-1 and 1.54 ± 0.095 µmol N L-1 (Table 3) in PI, respectively.

37 
The average ratio of PC:PN (8.63 ± 0.213) decreased (Figure 2.4 F), however, none of 
the changes in PC, PN and the ratio showed a significant linear trend during PI (Table 3).  
 
TChl a concentrations declined linearly (Table 3, Figure 2.4 A), after the July 1 
peak, and were primarily composed of smaller cells (Figure 2.4 B), while bSiO2 
concentrations were consistently low (0.215 ± 0.015 µmol L-1, Figure 2.4 C) in PII. In 
contrast, significant linear increases were measured in PC and PN, with mean 
concentrations of 16.9 ± 0.830 µmol C L-1 and 1.62 ± 0.086 µmol N L-1 (Table 3). The 
mean ratio of PC:PN was higher in PII than in PI (10.7 ± 0.320 mol:mol), with no 
obvious trend (Figure 2.4 F, Table 3). 
Over PIII, the concentration of TChl a (Figure 2.4 A) increased, however, only 
the percent contribution increase of cells >20 µm to Chl a (Figure 2.4 B) was significant 
(Table 3) and reached a maximum (52% of  TChl a) on August 1. Concentrations of 
bSiO2 strongly increased (Table 3, Figure 2.4 C) and likewise reached a maximum on 
August 1 (0.798 ± 0.093 µmol L-1). The average PC and PN concentrations were 15.3 ± 
0.383 µmol C L-1 and 1.64 ± 0.120 µmol N L-1, respectively, and PC:PN was 9.94 ± 
0.681 (mol:mol) over PIII (Table 2). 
2.3.3. (b) Carbon and Nitrate utilisation 
On average, carbon utilisation (rC) and nitrate utilisation (rNO3-) were 0.249 ± 
0.02 µmol C L-1 d-1 and 0.0748 ± 0.0135 µmol N L-1 d-1, respectively, over the entire 
sampling period.  
During PI, rC and rNO3- utilisation rates were on average 0.219 ± 0.048 µmol C 
L-1 d-1 and 0.06 ± 0.022 µmol N L-1 d-1, respectively (Figure 2.5 A and B, Table 3). From 
June 17 to the sea-ice break up on the July 1, daily rC increased linearly (Table 3) and

38 
reached its maximum (0.549 ± 0.046 µmol C L-1 d-1) on June 29 (Figure 2.5 A). 
Likewise, rNO3- also increased (Figure 2.5 B) in this period, peaking in PI on June 30 
(0.281 ± 0.094 µmol N L-1 d-1); although the maximum rNO3- peaked just post the sea 
ice break in PII. The majority of rC and rNO3- utilisation in PI was due to cells <5 µm 
(83 ± 7 % and 74 ± 10%, respectively).  
Primary production declined in PII after the rC peak observed in PI, however it 
plateaued to an average rate of 0.281 ± 0.013 µmol C L-1 d-1, with no linear trends 
(Figure 2.5 A, Table 3). In contrast, rNO3- decreased in PII linearly with an average of 
0.082 ± 0.028 µmol N L-1 d-1 (Figure 2.5 B, Table 3). The overall maximum rNO3- 
(0.294 ± 0.057 µmol N L-1 d-1) occurred two days after the sea-ice break-up on July 4, 
five days after the rC maximum. The dominant phytoplankton contributing to rC and 
rNO3- in PII were the <5 µm cells (89 ± 2% and 86 ± 5%, respectively). 
 
Although rC increased in PIII, it was variable, reaching a maximum of 0.414 ± 
0.08 µmol C L-1 d-1 on August 1 (Figure 2.5 A, Table 3). Over the course of PIII, rNO3- 
increased and reached a maximum of 0.230 ± 0.04 µmol N L-1 d-1 on August 3 (Figure 
2.5 B, Table 3). In PIII, the contribution of the <5 µm cells decreased for both rC and 
rNO3- (63 ± 6% and 60 ± 8%, respectively) (Figure 2.5 A and B). Small cells contributed 
the least to both rC and rNO3- (40% and 28%) on August 3. 
2.3.4 Silica production  
2.3.4 (a) Bulk Phytoplankton Assemblage silica production 
Over the course of the entire sampling period rSi was variable, with a mean of  
0.142 ± 0.0198 µmol SiO2 L-1 d-1). No linear trends in rSi were observed across any of

the three phases (Table 3); however, the mean rSi and standard error, differed between 
phases: PI = 0.136 ± 0.026 µmol Si L-1 d-1, PII = 0.032 ± 0.016 µmol Si L-1 d-1 and PIII = 
0.228 ± 0.029 µmol Si L-1 d-1 (Table 2). The maximum rSi (0.429 µmol Si L-1 d-1) was 
measure in PIII on July 21. 
2.3.4.(b) Taxon-specific silica production 
On average, Chaetoceros spp. contributed the greatest to rSi (Figure 2.5 D) 
during the study period (52.5%), despite Chaetoceros spp. only representing 48% of total 
diatom abundance (see section 2.3.5). Chaetoceros spp. cells reached their maximum 
contribution to rSi (98%) on July 28 in PIII. 
In PI, on June 20 and 28 rSi was dominated by unknown cells. In PII, there was 
very low rSi (mean: 0.009 ± 0.02 µmol Si L-1 d-1, Figure 2.5 C). On July 10, Chaetoceros 
spp. dominated (84%) the rSi (Figure 2.5 D), however, less than 5 cells could be 
identified and counted within each selected FOV, corresponding to the low rSi in PII. 
Due to higher bSiO2 during PIII, more samples were analysed to assess the 
taxonomic contribution of diatoms to rSi (n = 7). Starting on July 14, the proportion of 
Chaetoceros spp. cells contributing to rSi rapidly increased from <1% to a maximum of 
98% on July 28 (Figure 2.5 D). After this, rSi by Chaetoceros spp. remained >76% until 
the end of the study period. Pennate diatoms in PIII reached a maximum contribution to 
rSi on July 30 (6.4%). In addition, other centric diatoms and Pseudo-nitschia spp. were 
responsible for minor contributions (<2%) to rSi. 
During periods of low cell counts and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a and 
bSiO2), cells that had incorporated the PDMPO dye were rare, and thus quantifying

41 
species contribution to rSi to a reliable variance was not possible. Furthermore, samples 
with low cell density contained fluorescing detritus, and unknown cells in all phases had 
incorporated PDMPO dye. This may have caused overestimations of rSi in the different 
phases. 
2.3.5 Phytoplankton Assemblages 
2.3.5. (a) Cell Counts and Assemblages Composition 
Phytoplankton cell abundance was on average 7.45 ± 1.2 x104 cells L-1 over the 
study period. Cell counts reached a maximum of 1.77 x 105 cells L-1 on August 3 (Figure 
2.6 A). The main taxa and their average contributions over the study period were diatoms 
(49 ± 4%), dinoflagellates (29  ± 4%), silicoflagellates (0.22 ± 0%), flagellates <7 µm (3.8  
± 1%), chrysophytes (4.9  ± 1%) and unknown phytoplankton cells (13 ± 3%) (Figure 2.6 
B). 
Phase I had the highest mean cell count (n = 5) of the three phases (8.8 ± 1.4 x 104 
cells L-1). The average diatom and dinoflagellate proportions were very similar in PI (41± 
4% and 39 ± 6%, respectively). Diatom assemblages in PI were diverse (Figure 2.6 C), 
with Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and aff. Synedropsis spp. dominating the assemblages. 
However, the overall dominant group was “other penates”, which represented 34% of the 
diatom assemblage and 15% of the whole phytoplankton assemblage. 
The most dominant dinoflagellate in PI was a small cell (~ 5 µm in diameter), 
identified as cf. Azadinium sp. On June 24, this genus accounted for 45% of all 
phytoplankton (data not shown). Scanning electron microscopy would be required to 
confirm the identification of cf. Azadinium sp., but this was beyond the scope of my 
study.

42 
No silicoflagellates were present in PI, however, chrysophytes (Dinobyron sp.) 
were present in the majority of PI samples (excluding July 1) and reached a maximum of 
~15% of the total assemblage on the June 28. The remainder of the phytoplankton 
assemblage in PI was composed of flagellates <7 µm (1 ± <1%) and unknown cells (11 ± 
6%). 
In PII, a decrease in cell numbers were observed (mean: 3.5 x 104 ± 1.9 x 104 cells 
L-1, n=3), and diatoms started to dominate (47 ± 9%) the phytoplankton assemblages 
(Figure 2.6 A and B). The dominant identified genera of diatoms in PII were Navicula 
spp. and Thalassionema spp. (Figure 2.6 C), however, “other penates” remained the 
dominant diatom group in PI (accounting for 46% of diatom assemblage and 21% of total 
phytoplankton assemblage). 
No Chaetoceros spp. were observed in PII, but “other centrics” and “other 
diatoms” represented 6% and 24% of the diatom assemblage and 2% and 12% of the 
whole phytoplankton assemblage, respectively. The number of dinoflagellate cells 
decreased in PII compared to PI, however, there was a large proportion of dinoflagellate 
cysts (32%) in the assemblage in PII (Figure 2.6 B). In comparison to PI, no 
silicoflagellates were identified in PII, however, the proportion of crysophytes 
(Dinobyron sp.) in the phytoplankton assemblage declined (2 ± 2%). Other contributors 
to PII were flagellates <7 µm (<1 ± <1%) and the remainder came from unknown cells 
(10 ± 5%). 
Phase III showed a rise in total cell counts to a mean of 8.2 x 104 ± 2.1 x 104  cells 
L-1, with a shift to greater diatom dominance (55 ± 8%) and a reduction in dinoflagellates 
(17  ± 6%) (Figure 2.6 A and B). The diatom genus driving the increase in proportion of

43 
diatoms relative to dinoflagellates in PIII was Chaetoceros spp. In PIII, Chaetoceros spp. 
accounted for 67% of the diatom assemblage and 40% of the total phytoplankton 
assemblage. In comparison, the second most dominant diatom genera in PIII was 
Thalassionema spp., which was 3% of the diatom assemblage and <1% of the total 
phytoplankton assemblage (Figure 2.6 C). Other pennates and other diatoms accounted 
for 13% and 6% of the diatom assemblage and 6% and 3% of the whole phytoplankton 
assemblages, respectively (Figure 2.6 C).  
The same dinoflagellate genera present in PII were also found in PIII in similar 
proportions (< 2% of the whole phytoplankton assemblage), however, the proportion of 
dinoflagellate cysts decreased from 32% in PII to 4% in PIII. The remainder of cells in 
PIII consisted of silicoflagellates (0.5 ± <1%), flagellates <7 µm (7 ± 2%), chrysophytes 
(4 ± 2%) and unknown cells (16 ± 3%).

2.3.5 (b) Phytoplankton Assemblage Similarity 
A Bray-Curtis dissimilarity cluster analysis on the reduced phytoplankton data 
(see section 2.2.10) indicated five significantly different groupings of phytoplankton 
assemblages over the duration of the sampling period (Figure 2.7, Table 4). Samples 
within groups had >60% similarity except for group e where the samples showed 40% 
similarity. 
Phase I presented a significantly different phytoplankton assemblage (group b) 
from both PII and PIII. Within PII, there were three significantly different assemblage 
groupings (groups a, c and e). Phase III was almost entirely composed of a significantly 
separate assemblage grouping (group d), with the exception of July 14, which grouped 
with a sample from July 13.  
The significant groupings derived from the SIMPROF test clustered out to 
samples close in sample date. This highlighted the phytoplankton assemblage succession 
over the spring-summer transition. Only group e had samples that were not consecutive 
through time. 
The environmental drivers controlling assemblage differences were assessed 
using a distance based linear model (DISTLM). The marginal DISTLM with ungrouped 
environmental variables found (in decreasing significance) that sea-ice thickness, O2 
concentration, seawater temperature, and Si(OH)4 and PAR had significant effects (p < 
0.05) on phytoplankton assemblage (Table 5). However, the DISTLM identified sea-ice 
thickness, O2 and Si(OH)4 as the most parsimonious environmental variables driving the 
phytoplankton assemblage structure (in order of decreasing importance, R2 = 0.505, RSS 
= 9.847 x 103).

The best fit model was visualised in a dbRDA plot, with vector length 
proportional to the variables contribution to total variation (Figure 2.8). The axes on the 
dbRDA plot show the explained variance. The first axis (x-axis) explains 47.15% of the 
fitted model and the y-axis explains 38.92%. This equates to 23.79% and 19.64% of total 
observed phytoplankton variation, cumulatively, 43.43% of the total variation observed 
in phytoplankton assemblages. 
2.3.6 Environmentally Driven Changes in Phytoplankton Dynamics 
To link biological dynamics to environmental and chemical variations in CB, I 
ran correlations between all variables for the different phases, PI, II and III (Tables 6 - 8). 
Note that pairs of variables did not remain significantly correlated throughout the three 
phases. 
In phase I, rC was correlated to the abundance of smaller cells (<5 µm), but there 
was no correlation between rC and TChl a (Table 6). Moreover, rC was strongly 
correlated to water temperature, O2, sea-ice thickness and rNO3- in PI (Table 6). 
Likewise, rNO3- was strongly negatively correlated to the ice thickness, however, rNO3- 
was strongly corelated to the ambient NO3- concentrations. Phosphate was strongly 
correlated with a number of variables in PI (Table 6), e.g. salinity, water temperature, O2 
and ice thickness. The measured TChl a (in vitro) and the Chl a fl. (in vivo) were 
negatively correlated and did not have a strong relationship with each other in PI (Table 
6). 
In contrast, rC was not significantly correlated to any of the measured 
environmental variables in PII. Nitrate utilisation was negatively correlated with wind

temperature and, in contrast to PI, it was positively correlated with Chl a fl. 
In phase III, rC was strongly significantly correlated to TChl a, but rNO3- had no 
significant correlations (Table 8). Similarly, TChl a had no other significant correlations, 
however the percent contribution of large cells (>20 µm) to Chl a had a strong 
relationship with bSiO2 (Table 8). bSiO2 concentration was negatively correlated to 
Si(OH)4 and positively correlated to Chl a fl. (Table 8). Nitrate concentrations had no 
significance correlations, whereas PO43- remained significantly correlated to water 
temperature, salinity and to oxygen concentration (Table 8). Silicic acid was negatively 
correlated to the % of > 20 µm Chl a and positively correlated to both wind speed and 
PAR (Table 8).

The coloured symbols indicate the SIMPROF assemblages (a-e) and the 
numbers are the date when each phytoplankton assemblage sample was 
collected in Cambridge Bay. Vector length is proportional to the contribution 
of the environmental variable to the total variation in phytoplankton 
assemblage. Log(ID) is the log-transformed sea ice-thickness, Log(O2) is the 
log-transformed oxygen concentration and Si(OH)4 is the silicic acid 
concentration.

2.4 Discussion 
In this study, I measured variations in sea-surface biological and chemical 
dynamics over a 2-month period during the phytoplankton growing season in CB. 
Primary productivity, phytoplankton biomass and nutrient concentrations were measured 
alongside ONC oceanographic parameters (i.e. water temperature and salinity) from mid-
June to early August of 2016, covering periods of sea-ice cover, sea-ice melt and open 
water conditions. This sampling approach allowed for high temporal resolution of 
measurements at a small scale, which facilitated the assessment of seasonal variability 
and potential driving factors of biological and chemical dynamics in an Arctic region. 
2.4.1 Overview of oceanographic conditions in Cambridge Bay during the study 
period 
The primary controls of marine PP in the Arctic (and elsewhere) are nutrient and 
light availability, which are regulated by oceanographic conditions such as mixing and 
sea-ice coverage (Codispoti et al, 2013). CB is a shallow bay with seasonal sea-ice 
coverage and low tidal mixing. The largest tidal range for this study period was 0.6 m 
(Canadian Hydrographic Society, 2018), limiting CB tidal velocities. Throughout the 
CAA, the general flow of water is from west to east; however the large riverine input and 
ice-melt in the CB area is thought to limit surface water exchange between Dease Strait 
and Coronation Gulf, and CB (McLaughlin et al., 2004; Campbell et al., 2016). This lack 
of mixing was reflected in surface salinities, which remained relatively low throughout 
the sampling period (28.5 ± 0.06) and other properties, such as water temperatures, which 
increased linearly, but had gradual daily changes, particularly through Phases I and II.

53 
Nitrate concentrations were low (0.674 ± 0.078 µmol L-1) throughout the study 
period. These values (along with Si(OH)4 and PO43- concentrations) are within the range 
documented for CAA surface waters (0.93 ± 0.40 µmol NO3- L-1; Varela et al., 2013; 
Crawford et al., 2018; Tremblay et al., 2009), and close to surface concentrations found 
in the oligotrophic regions of the Arctic Ocean, such as the Canada Basin (0.27  ± 0.09 
µmol NO3- L-1; Varela et al., 2013; Crawford et al., 2018). However, similar NO3- 
concentrations have been reported in Dease Strait (Campbell et al., 2016), but from 
earlier in the season (April – early June in 2014). They attributed the low NO3- 
concentrations to limited mixing with adjacent nutrient-replete water masses and spring 
stratification, which can limit PP. The slightly lower concentrations measured in our 2016 
study could indicate that surface nutrients had been depleted prior to mid-June. In fact, 
Campbell et al., (2017) documented sea-ice algae to be net-autotrophic from early May 
onwards, and therefore algal growth could have further depleted surface nutrient stocks. 
Moreover, in this study, sea ice melted substantially more than during the Campbell et al. 
(2016) study, thus a greater dilution of dissolved nutrients may have occurred. 
Alternatively, differences may just be due to interannual variability in nutrient stocks due 
to differences in mixing and freshwater inputs. Likewise, phytoplankton biomass and PP 
in CB are lower than average surface values reported within the CAA domain (Varela et 
al., 2013; Crawford et al., 2018).

2.4.2 Drivers of Phytoplankton Dynamics in Cambridge Bay 
Although biomass and PP were low throughout the sampling period, different 
biological regimes were observed over time. Laboratory culture studies often isolate 
individual abiotic variable, e.g. light or temperature, to better grasp phytoplankton 
responses (e.g. Waring et al., 2010; Raven and Geider, 1988), which aid our 
understanding of algae in nature. However, natural marine ecosystems are far more 
complex and are subject to multifaceted regime shifts. Individual environmental variables 
can act synergistically to impact biological rates, and such interplay of environmental 
variables and their impact on phytoplankton can shift over temporal and spatial scales 
(Boyd et al., 2010). This complexity of environmental variables was captured in the 
correlations between the three phases identified in CB for the study period, where no two 
variables consistency correlated over time during the study period. In the following 
sections, fine-scale environmental shifts are discussed as potential drivers of observed 
seasonal changes in PP, and phytoplankton biomass and taxa for each of the three phases 
 
2.4.2. (a) Nutrient dynamics and phytoplankton nutrient utilisation in Cambridge Bay 
during PI 
Phase I had the most NO3- depleted surface waters of the study period, with 
average nutrient ratios (N:P = 0.542 ± 0.099, Si:N = 15.1 ± 2.24, Appendix B) indicating 
that NO3- was likely the limiting factor for PP. Nitrate increased by one order of 
magnitude on June 30 (Figure 2.3), coinciding and correlating with the largest increase in 
rC and rNO3- (Figure 2.5 A and B, Table 6). This spike in NO3- coincided with 
horizontal surface movement of the sea ice, prior to sea-ice break, which may have 
caused some upwelling or mixing due to the shear stress of ice movement on the water

58 
interface (Williams and Carmack, 2015). Nitrate utilisation correlated to PAR, however, 
the strongest relationship was between rNO3- and NO3- (Table 6). This suggested that 
while light may have had a role in the increased rNO3-, the available NO3- was the 
controlling factor.  
The increase in rC could have also been associated to other recycled sources of 
nitrogen, such as ammonium or urea-N, and resulted from an increase in regenerated 
production (Dugale and Goering, 1967). Ammonium and urea are important nitrogen 
sources in oligotrophic (Shilova et al., 2017) and Arctic marine regions (Varela et al., 
2013). However, this study did not measure other sources of nitrogen, thus regenerated 
production cannot be accurately quantified.  
Silica production, rSi, was very variable in PI and no environmental drivers were 
clearly correlated to this variability. Some of the variation observed in PI may be due to 
the labelling of non-siliceous cells, which has been documented when diatoms cell counts 
are low (Long, 2015).  
The diatom taxa contributing to rSi in PI were Chaetoceros spp., Thalassionema 
spp., Pseudo-nitzschia spp., Amphora spp. and unknown pennates despite their low 
abundance. In contrast, small dinoflagellate cells dominated biomass (84% ± 1.45%) and 
rC (83% ± 0.07%) in PI. The erroneous labelling of non-siliceous cells resulted in an 
overestimation of silica production by diatoms. This may have uncoupled certain 
correlations, e.g. the expected draw-down of Si(OH)4 with increasing rSi and potentially 
correlations with other variables. Silica production was, as expected, greater than net 
bSiO2 as the PDMPO method measures a rate closer to gross silica production, whereas 
the net bSiO2 method incorporates dissolution.

59 
2.4.2 (b) The combined effects of temperature, light and nutrient limitation on primary 
production during PI  
Carbon utilisation positively correlated with increasing water temperatures, as did 
rNO3-, yet the relationship was not strongly significant (Table 6). The average daily 
surface water temperature transitioned from -0.9°C to -0.02°C in PI, which could have 
caused an increase in metabolic efficiency of phytoplankton cells, leading to greater rC. 
Temperature rises can increase the electrochemical turnover time of the electron carriers 
within the photosystem, which are reduced at sub-zero temperatures (Falkowski and 
Raven, 2007). Toseland et al. (2013) found that across varying biogeographical regions, 
temperature accounted for 28.32% of metabolic variability in phytoplankton.  
Temperature-dependent biosynthesis is widely documented in the literature. An 
early paper by Eppley’s (1972) described the Q10 factor (Equation 1, see also Toseland 
et al., 2013).  
rC" = $1.88 × 
(∆,)
".  / × rC.   
 
 
Equation 1 
Whereby, rC1 is the expected carbon utilisation rate at the increased water temperature, 
1.88 is an empirically determined rate constant for carbon metabolism (Eppley, 1972), 
DT is the difference between the temperature at a new point in time (T1) and the initial 
temperature (T0), and rC0 is the initial carbon utilisation at T0. I applied the Q10 factor to 
my PI rC and temperature data, and found that the percentage variation in the rC 
attributable to temperature-dependent biosynthesis was negligible (<1%), thus other 
variables should be considered. 
Light limiting conditions usually results in cells to investment more resources to  
the light harvesting apparatus in the cell (Marañon et al., 2014). However, for synthesis 
of more photosynthetic components, more nutrients would be required (Falkowski and

60 
Raven, 2007), thus early nutrient conditions during PI may also have limited rC. I 
suggest that the gradual reduction in temperature, light and nutrient stress over PI likely 
explains the increasing rC. The impacts of irradiance on the metabolic efficiency and in 
vivo fluorescence is discussed further in chapter 3 of this thesis. 
 
2.4.2. (c) Variations of particulates and phytoplankton in PI 
Total chlorophyll a positively correlated with PAR in PI, suggesting the initial 
increase in water column light penetration contributed to the increased biomass. Cell 
count data (n = 5) appeared to follow trends in TChl a, thus our increased TChl a values 
likely reflect an increase in cell biomass. Because this study did not look at the individual 
cellular chlorophyll a levels, the increase in PI may also reflect a shift in the cellular 
concentrations. Moreover, at low temperatures, chlorophyll a per cell can be reduced 
(Falkowski and Raven, 2007), thus the increase in TChl a may be co-controlled by the 
increase in both PAR and temperature increase in PI, although the TChl a to water 
temperature relationship was non-significant. Additionally, the average TChl a to PC 
ratio was highest in PI (see Appendix B) suggesting the cells required greater light 
harvesting capabilities (Hessen et al. 2002) while under ice in CB. 
There was no significant correlation between TChl a and rC in PI. The lack of 
relationship between TChl a and rC occurred due to a small TChl a peak observed 
between June 18 and 24. On June 18, a precipitation event resulted in a large increase in 
the volume of water on the sea-ice surface, which drained by June 21. Flushing of 
organisms from sea ice has been proposed through brine gravity draining events 
(Gradinger et al., 1991). Although due to a different mechanism, the draining of meteoric 
water through the ice likely flushed any remaining sea-ice algae cells into surface waters

61 
and could explain the discrepancy between an increase in the chlorophyll a and bSiO2, 
without a corresponding peak in the rC. Ice algae grow earlier in the season due to low-
light adaptation (Leu et al., 2011). Experiments with light unacclimated culture of ice-
algae have shown reduced growth rates at light levels >42 µmol photons m2 s-1 (Juhl and 
Krembs, 2010). In PI, daily average PAR at 8 m depth was 38 ± 4 µmol photons m2 s-1 
and the increase over time was significant, which may suggest that there would be no 
opportunity for ice-algal cells to acclimate and thus their growth would remain depressed.  
The PI phytoplankton assemblage was dominated by pennate diatoms and the 
diatom Pseudo-nitzschia, in agreement with Gosselin et al. (1997) who found that 
pennate diatoms dominated sea-ice algal assemblages. Campbell et al., (2018) found 
Navicula and Pseudo-nitzschia sp. in Dease Strait sea ice, and due to its proximity we 
might expect comparable assemblages in CB. The strong positive correlation between 
TChl a and rC without the data from June 18 – 24 (r = 0.75), further indicates that the 
increase of TChl a was likely senescent ice-algal cells. Likewise, the small percentage of 
rC attributed to cells >5 µm further corroborated the hypothesis that pennate and Pseudo-
nitzschia diatoms (>5 µm) were not actively growing. Furthermore, very few diatom cells 
were labelled with PDMPO, which corroborates this theory. Rysgaard et al., (1999) 
observed low surface PP during sea-ice coverage and suggested that residual chlorophyll 
a in the surface water was associated to the ice-algal community. Moreover, smaller cells 
contributing more to rC in PI was not an unexpected result, as small cells are more 
efficient in nutrient-depleted waters under sea ice (Li et al., 2009; Gosselin et al., 1997), 
due to their higher surface area to volume ratios.

62 
The molar PC:PN ratios were higher (see Appendix B) than the Redfield (1958) 
ratio of 6.6 and average values from integrated water column values (4.8-5.6) reported in 
the CAA (Crawford et al., 2015). Low concentrations of dissolved nutrients can 
potentially elevate stoichiometric ratios (Martiny et al., 2013).Nitrogen limitation has 
been shown to cause a two-fold increase in cellular C:N ratios in a chlorophyte species 
(Hessen et al., 2013). In the low nutrient Beaufort - Canada Basin region the reported 
POC:PON ratios were lower (2.65 ± 0.19) than in this study (Crawford et al., 2015). 
However, ratios in CB were not correlated significantly with any of the measured 
environmental or dissolved nutrients, suggesting a different mechanism. Phytoplankton 
taxonomy can also influence the elemental stoichiometry of an assemblage (Martiny et 
al., 2013). Quigg et al., (2003) found statistically different cellular C:N ratios between 
different eukaryotic phyla and superfamilies. They documented the highest ratios in 
dinoflagellates, which were present throughout my study, but most dominant in PI. While 
the contribution of dinoflagellates could be the cause of the overall elevated ratios, it does 
not explain the differences between the phases, as PI has the greatest dominance of 
dinoflagellates but the lowest PC:PN average (8.63 ± 0.2, Appendix B).  
 
2.4.2. (d) Nutrient dynamics and phytoplankton growth during PII 
Although both rC and NO3- declined from the PI peak to PII, they subsequently 
plateaued, resulting in PII having the highest average rC (mean:0.281 ± 0.01 µmol C L-1 
d-1). Likewise, the average rNO3- also increased in PII compared to PI (mean: 0.082 ± 
0.03 µmol N L-1 d-1). The increased utilisation rates were likely due to the increased NO3- 
availability, further demonstrated by the N:P and Si:N ratios in PII, which were higher 
and lower than in PI, respectively (Appendix B). In PII increased air temperature and

63 
decreased wind-speed strengthened surface stratification, reflected by constant salinity 
and persistent gradual warming of the surface waters. Hence, the source and driving 
environmental factors of increased NO3- in PII is unclear, as there was little evidence of 
persistent mixing in surface waters after sea-ice break up.  
One explanation is tidal pressure gradients, which have previously been proposed 
as a source of nutrient re-supply in inlet systems (e.g. Gargette et al., 2003). However, 
low tidal forcing is expected in CB due the small tidal range (Canadian Hydrographic 
Society, 2018). Although small, a daily tidal cycle was seen in the per minute water 
temperature and salinity ONC data (not shown) and were more pronounced when sea-ice 
was absent. This suggested that sea-ice may suppress tidal velocities, possibly due to 
friction at the ice-water interface (St-Laurent et al., 2008). Assuming that tides play a role 
in nutrient supply to CB, any increase in tidal velocity, such as that observed in the 
transition from PI-PII, would result in a resupply of nutrients to the surface. Greater, and 
more consistent, nutrient supply would increase PP levels, as observed in PII. However, 
further investigations are necessary to draw conclusions on the role of tides in nutrient 
replenishment in the CB area.  
 
2.4.2 (e)Variation in particulates and phytoplankton assemblages during PII 
In contrast to rC in PII, TChl a declined and reached its lowest concentration, 
although it was only marginally lower than in PIII. Both rC and TChl a were dominated 
by cells <5µm, but there was no statistically significant relationship between the two. 
 The drop in TChl a resulted in a reduction in TChl a:PC ratio (see Appendix B), 
in comparison to PI. The plasticity of phytoplankton cells enables them to adapt their 
photosynthetic machinery, such as reducing metabolic investment to light-harvesting

64 
pigments in response to increased light levels (Hessen et al., 2002). Thus, it is possible 
that the reduction in TChl a was a response to the increased light availability in PII 
(Hessen et al 2002). However, this was not significantly reflected in the TChl a 
correlation with PAR, although the relationship was negative, suggesting that another 
mechanism may be responsible 
Initial seasonal stratification of the water column is often discussed as increasing 
PP in the euphotic zone through the entrainment of cells into the upper water column 
where light and nutrients are often initially high. However, as my study is limited to the 
very surface (5 m) rather than the whole euphotic zone, I propose that with water 
stabilisation in PII, larger phytoplankton cells would settle out of our sampling depth, due 
to greater settling velocities, as per Stokes Law (Eppley et al., 1967). Eppley et al. (1967) 
inferred potential settling rates of ~1 m d-1 for cells >10 µm in diameter, thus any large 
cells could sink out of sampling depth within five days, if no physical mixing occurred. 
This settling rate may explain the high contribution of <5 µm cells to TChl a and rC in 
PII when water conditions were stable. Although, the smaller cells would result in lower 
biomass, these cells would still be able to take advantage of the increased NO3- at 5 m 
and fix carbon. A positive correlation between the percent contribution of larger cell to 
TChl a and wind speeds suggest that wind may be instrumental in mixing larger cells into 
the surface.  
An interesting discrepancy was that the PC continued to increase in PII, further 
contributing to a reduction in the TChl a:PC ratio (see Appendix B). The increase in PC 
was contrary to other phytoplankton biomass indicators in PII, as cell counts, TChl a and 
bSiO2 all declined and rSi was very low. Although, the increase in PC does not correlate

65 
with rC, it could represent an accumulation of fixed carbon over time, while the rC 
remained constant. Alternatively, the PC increase may reflect an increase in 
microzooplankton grazers, such as ciliates, which were seen in the phytoplankton 
taxonomic samples. While increased grazing pressure could also account for the 
reduction in cell numbers, bSi and TChl a, generally ecological stoichiometry indicates 
that herbivores have lower C:N ratios than the algae they consume (Hessen et al., 2013). 
Crawford et al. (2015) suggested that an increase in Arctic heterotrophic grazers could 
have decreased their reported POC:PON ratios, when the phytoplankton contribution to 
POC were low, whereas in PII our PC:PN increased.  
Overall elevated PC:PN ratios in CB raised some questions, particularly, with the 
discrepancy of increasing PC in PII. Thus, another contributing factor had to be 
considered. This discrepancy was emphasised by the different ratios in the Canada Basin, 
where nutrients and production are similar to CB (Crawford et al., 2015). One obvious 
difference between the two locations is the physical characteristics. My field site was in a 
land-enclosed bay, where water sampling occurred ~200 m from the shore line, whereas 
the Canada Basin is oceanic. Victoria Island is composed of carbonate and siliciclastic 
bedrock (Kemp et al., 1997), thus terrigenous sediments, e.g. wind-blown dust, would 
likely have carbonate and lithogenic Si components and may impact our measured 
particulates. Carbonate rocks have been found to have mean N concentrations of 130 µg 
g-1 of rock and corresponding to the approximate carbon content of CaCO3 rocks the C:N 
ratios would be high ~920 (Johnson and Goldblatt, 2015). As our data reflects the total 
PC:PN, rather than just organic particulates, the higher ratio could be due to terrigenous 
dust containing inorganic carbon. Dust input could further increase in PII and PIII, when

66 
there was no sea ice cover, however PC also changes due to biological activity. 
Moreover, the peak riverine flow occurs in early July within the region (Kristina Brown, 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans, personal communication), which might lead to a 
greater riverine input of terrigenous C and N. 
 
2.4.2 (f) Nutrient dynamics and phytoplankton growth during PIII 
Phase III exhibited greater environmental variability. The largest changes in 
salinity and temperature occurred on July 14-16 and July 21-22, in conjunction with 
spring and neap tidal phases when wind speeds were higher. Between July 14 to 16, 
seawater daily average temperature dropped from 0.83 to -0.19°C, and salinity increased 
from 28.7 to 29.3 PSU, suggesting that oceanic water was being driven into the bay over 
the ONC observatory, or upwelling of denser deeper waters occurred. The first mixing 
event, on July 14, coincided with a NO3-  increase to the maximum recorded NO3- 
concentration during this study, a spike in salinity and a drop in water temperatures. The 
wind direction was to the north-west, into the bay, on July 14 and 15 (data not shown) 
suggesting that more oceanic water was being pushed into the bay. Contrastingly, high 
wind-speeds recorded on July 21 were to the south-east, and water temperature (3.2°C) 
increased while salinity declined (27.4 PSU). This was likely indicative of a complete 
overturning of the upper surface layer above the observatory as these waters would 
characteristically be fresher, from earlier sea-ice-melt, and warmer after elevated 
atmospheric temperatures and irradiance during PII. I propose that wind speed and 
direction were the strongest forces driving surface mixing in CB. Tidal mixing potentially 
impacted mixing additionally, particularly on July 21 that was close to the spring tide 
maximal range.

67 
After the initial mixing event on July 14, the proportion of total rC by >5 µm 
cells increased. It is likely that the mixing event shifted conditions to those favourable for 
Chaetoceros spp. as their percent abundance increased in PIII. Although the mean rC for 
PIII was slightly lower than in PII (0.254 ± 0.02 µmol C L-1 d-1), it reached a maximum 
of 0.414 µmol C L-1 d-1 on August 1. I suggest that, although more variable, conditions in 
PIII enabled greater PP rates.  
 
2.4.2.(g)Variation in particulates and phytoplankton assemblages during PIII 
The phytoplankton assemblage in PIII was progressively dominated by diatoms, 
specifically Chaetoceros spp., corresponding to the linear increase in the amount of 
bSiO2 and the contribution of cells > 20 µm to total chlorophyll. Chaetoceros spp. cells 
were found in low numbers in PI and only a few of cells were labelled with PDMPO in 
PII, thus the changing environmental conditions potentially enabled them to bloom (see 
section 2.4.2 (h)). Alternatively, water being pushed and upwelled into the bay on July 14 
may have re-introduced Chaetoceros spp. cells into the surface waters. The dominance of 
Chaetoceos spp. in PIII is further apparent as their contribution to whole-assemblage rSi 
reached a maximum of 98%. Sarthou et al., (2005) suggested that elemental ratios of 
bSiO2:POC and bSiO2:PON of 0.11 and 0.8, respectively, are characteristic of diatoms. 
Our bSiO2:POC and bSiO2:PON ratios were highest in PIII (0.03 and 0.31, respectively) 
(see Appendix B). The bSiO2:PC reached a maximum on August 1 (0.052 ± 0.008) and 
the bSiO2:PN was at its maximum on August 3 (0.612 ± 0.098), which further indicates 
the increased dominance of diatoms in the phytoplankton assemblage.

2.4.2. (h) A Multivariate Approach to Assess Phytoplankton Assemblage and 
Environmental Drivers 
The seasonal shift in phytoplankton assemblages in many marine systems has 
been documented to correlate with changes in environmental variables, e.g. diatoms 
increase when there is greater Si(OH)4 available in Saanich Inlet in British Columbia 
(Grundle et al., 2009). Specific taxa of phytoplankton are characterised by being able to 
exploit certain niche conditions, e.g. diatoms are often successful at rapid nutrient uptake 
when nutrient concentrations increase (Falkowski and Raven, 2007). Hence, I expected 
that the changing environmental conditions (Figures 2.3 and 2.4) would support different 
phytoplankton assemblages (Figure 2.6) over the 1.5-month study period. 
The decreasing sea-ice thickness vector (Figure 2.8) correlated mainly with 
assemblage b (green triangles), which was dominated by small (£5 µm) flagellated cells 
(potentially Azadinium sp.), and had greater success under the sea-ice regime (Figure 
2.8). The sea-ice variable encapsulated the low nutrient and light collectively and was 
selected as the primary characteristic of the phytoplankton group b assemblage.  
Group d is associated with the total decline of sea ice, increasing oxygen 
concentration and decreasing Si(OH)4, coinciding with a bloom of the diatom 
Chaetoceros spp. (Figure 2.8). Diatoms utilise the available Si(OH)4, which is seen down 
the drawdown of Si(OH)4 in PIII and as they are utilising carbon via photosynthesis they 
produce oxygen, adding to the seasonal surface oxygen accumulation. 
In this study, I measured a shift in NO3-, relieving limitation of PP between PI and 
PII (see Appendix B). When a limiting nutrient becomes depleted in a system, it will 
drive a shift towards a predominance of a different species with nutrient requirements 
aligning to the new nutrient regime (Sakshaug et al., 2004). In the DISTLM model, it was

69 
expected that the phytoplankton taxa shift would be primarily driven by the NO3- 
increase. However, this multivariate analysis method may not capture the diatoms’ ability 
to rapidly uptake ambient N stocks and store intracellularly, thereby outcompeting other 
cells to bloom. In such a case, an increased in ambient NO3- would not immediately 
correlate to increased diatom abundance as a time lag would likely occur. Therefore, the 
matching of the abundance similarity matrix to the changes in NO3- within the 
environmental matrix might not align. Consequently, NO3- may not be selected as a 
strong driver within the DISTLM for the increase in Chaetoceros spp. in PIII. 
Alternatively, if we consider oxygen as a response variable, rather than a 
predictor, and remove it from the model, the best fitting environmental variables 
matching the changes in phytoplankton assemblages are ice thickness and water 
temperature. Together these explain ~40% of the total variance in phytoplankton 
assemblages. In this case, increasing water temperatures was the primary driver of the 
shift from cf. Azadinum sp. and a mixed assemblage to the Chaetorceros spp.-dominated 
assemblage. This suggested that the warmer water temperature recorded in PIII (1.9 ± 
0.48 °C) was required for Chaetorceros spp. diatoms to bloom. Subsequently, we should 
consider more oxygenated waters in CB as an indicative characteristic of more 
photosynthesis and thus phytoplankton cells, i.e. in 2016 the O2 increase was a product of 
a Cheatoceros spp. bloom, rather than a driving factor. During PIII, water temperatures 
were more variable but continued to linearly increase, resulting in a higher mean (1.9 ± 
0.48 °C) than in PI and PII (-0.36 ± 0.08 °C and 0.52 ± 0.05 °C, respectively; Table 2). 
Water temperature is often considered a controlling factor for species succession (Suzuki 
and Takahashi, 1995), thus the temperature rise may have reached a critical point where

70 
Chaetoceors spp. could have then outcompeted other phytoplankton. Blais et al. (2017) 
found a significant positive correlation between the number of centric diatoms 
(dominated by Chaetoceros spp.) and temperature in both the Beaufort Sea and Baffin 
Bay. However, an earlier review by Boyd et al., (2010) suggests that the control of 
temperature on diatoms still remained controversial and that N is postulated to be the 
primary controlling factor of diatoms. While not part of the selected model, PAR was 
found to be significant as a single variable. Diatoms have been found to be particularly 
successful at dissipating excessive light energy when over-saturated (Ruban et al., 2004), 
which likely aided their dominance in PIII. 
2.4.3 Primary Production Across the Arctic and Future Implications 
 
I compiled a number of reported surface PP rates for multiple regions in the 
Arctic (Table 9) to assess how PP rates in CB in 2016 compared to historical data. 
Extracting values for the surface waters from the literature was challenging as many 
studies report their findings as integrated values for the water column, rather than as 
depth profiles or discrete values. Furthermore, open access to the data used to produce 
papers is not yet a wide spread practice, thus extraction of actual values, e.g. for example 
from figures using colour scales, presents a challenge. The scientific movement to 
transparent open access data sets will improve future meta-analysis of data. Of particular 
commendation was the open access to the ARCSS-PP data set from the National 
Oceanographic Data Centre compiled by Matrai et al., (2013), which proved to be an 
excellent and extensive data source, from which I have used only a subset of the data. I 
also had access to previous data sets produced by members of Dr. Varela’s lab. In 
addition some values were extracted directly from published papers (Table 9).

71 
For comparison to our own data, I converted published PP rates from mg C m3 d-1 
to µmol C L-1 d-1. The most comparable sample depths available were selected. When 
multiple values for the same geographical location and depth occurred at the same time, I 
averaged all values. Surface PP rates from individual studies have been averaged over 
time and space depending on the location and duration of the study, with an effort to stay 
true to the original authors definition of regions. Very little data was found for the Kara, 
Laptev and East Siberian Seas. 
 
Our average daily PP in CB was 0.249 ± 0.02 µmol C L-1 d-1, with a maximum 
rate of 0.55 µmol C L-1 d-1 on June 29. The majority of PP in Arctic coastal regions is far 
larger than CB rates (Table 9). The average rates I have reported in CB are more 
comparable to summer surface (0-6 m) values from the Canada Basin (Varela et al., 
2013; Hill and Cota, 2005). 
In contrast, PP values reported in the Bering Strait and Chukchi Sea are orders of 
magnitude larger than those found in CB (Table 9), e.g. Gosselin et al. (1997) 
documented highs of 19.15 ± 6.50 µmol C L-1 d-1 in the Bering Strait, July 1987. 
Giesbrecht et al. (2018) found average July PP rates of 13.81 ± 3.64 µmol C L-1 d-1 in the 
Chukchi Sea, but also highlighted a strong spatial variation between eastern and western 
stations in the South Chukchi region (DBO3). Giesbrecht et al., (2018) values from the 
eastern region (0.77  ± 0.17 µmol C L-1 d-1) are much more comparable to CB rates. 
Giesbrecht et al., (2018) attributed the differences in biological activity between E and W 
to differing water masses properties. The eastern region, along the Alaskan coastline, is 
nutrient depleted, warmer and fresher. Consequently, it supports less PP and biomass, and 
phytoplankton assemblages are dominated by coccolithophores and flagellated cells over

72 
diatoms. Similarly, the Canada Basin shows low PP rates and low NO3- concentrations 
(<1µmol L-1) (Hill and Cota, 2005; Varela et al., 2013). 
  
Further to the East of the Canadian Arctic, in Danborg Fjord (~74°N) on the East 
coast of Greenland, Rysgaard et al. (1999) sampled seawater phytoplankton biomass and 
nutrients and measure PP from sea ice coverage (1.5 m and 0.4 m of snow coverage) to 
open waters spanning from mid-June to late August in 1996. They found surface PP 
ranging 0.167- 0.333 µmol C L-1 d-1 with diatoms dominating assemblages, however, the 
bloom was found in deeper waters later in the season as surface nutrients became 
depleted (NO3- and NH4+ concentrations <0.2 µmol L-1). Likewise, in CB the production 
by diatoms was most apparent when surface NO3- values were >0.4 µmol (Rysgaard et al. 
1999). Furthermore, Hegseth et al., (1998) also found low values of PP in the northern 
region of Barents Sea, which was composed of small dinoflagellates and other flagellated 
cells. 
A caveat of such comparisons of data is the spatial and temporal differences 
among studies, e.g. the surface values representing the CAA from Varela et al. (2013) is 
the average from four locations sampled over eight days. Likewise, samples from the 
Hegseth et al., (1998) study from the Northern Barents span a short period of time (2 
days). Therefore, although some data points are close to the average value measured in 
Cambridge Bay, it is conceivable that with an alternate sampling time in the growing 
season, rates may differ. One limitation of the data set in this study is that sampling was 
only conducted within the surface water and thus likely does not capture any potential 
sub-surface production in the region which seems wide-spread across the Arctic (e.g. 
McLaughlin and Carmack, 2010; Varela et al., 2013). A finding that has been reiterated

73 
with data sets spanning multiple years within the same region is that there is a great deal 
of interannual variability in the levels and peaks of production within regions (e.g. Blais 
et al., 2017; Giesbrecht et al., 2018). Therefore, all studies continue to underscore the 
necessity of more field research, with a wider spatial and temporal coverage. 
The rapid changes occurring in the Arctic due to climate change have been 
broadly accepted in the literature. The review paper by Wassman et al., (2011) 
highlighted discernible climate driven changes within marine ecosystems and the 
pressing need for further research, which is now heavily cited in more recent literature. 
There remains inherent uncertainty as much of the research on climate-driven biological 
change in the Arctic comes belatedly. Therefore, we simply have no solid base-line data 
prior to anthropogenically driven climate change (Wassmann et al., 2011). 
Correspondingly, there has been some controversy amongst predictions of phytoplankton 
production responses to climate driven changes (e.g. Arrigo and Van Dijken, 2015; Li et 
al., 2009; Steinacher et al., 2010). This apparent controversy may be a product of the 
diverse nature of the Arctic Ocean and Seas (Tremblay et al, 2015). Furthermore, the 
interannually variability observed may obscure climate change driven biological 
variability (e.g. Grebmeir et al., 2009; Giesbrecht et al., 2018).  
The outflow shelves such as the CAA are expected to have an increase in 
freshwater supply with increased stratification in the Canada Basin, which is already 
observed due to increased run-off (Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2009). A predicted outcome 
of such climate driven change is the reduction of nutrient sock in Arctic surface waters 
(Tremblay et al., 2015). Contrary to predictions of increased PP, increased stratification 
in Cambridge Bay will likely result in a decreases in PP. Li et al (2009) documented

74 
decreased phytoplankton cell sizes with greater stratification in the Canada Basin, thus 
we might expect the phytoplankton assemblage to be persistently dominated by smaller 
cells in Cambridge Bay.  
Contrary to stratification impacts, with less ice-coverage the water column would 
have greater exposure to wind-driven mixing, which I suggest is the primary force for 
surface mixing in Cambridge Bay. Thus, with more exposure there is the potential for 
more mixing. Likewise, the tidal velocities may be less dampened without the presence 
of sea-ice, which could influence the amount of mixing in the surface.

 Even on a localised scale there is inherent uncertainty predicting the impacts of 
climate change on PP, and only more data can help resolve the uncertainty. A decrease in 
carbon fixation in CB surface waters would have a small impact on a global scale, since 
the production rates and biomass are already minimal. However, the low productivity and 
biomass we have reported in CB may be an example of what surface waters in other areas 
of the Arctic transition to, with increasing impacts of climate change. Any reduction in 
the overall efficiency of the biological carbon pump in the Arctic would have broad 
impacts for the global carbon cycle. 
 
2.5 Conclusion 
I propose that during the sampling period in CB, the main control on biological 
PP was NO3- availability, which resulted in an overall low phytoplankton biomass (TChl 
a, 0.112 ± 0.005 µg L-1) and PP (rC, 0.249 ± 0.02 µmol C L-1 d-1). I conclude that 
physical mixing in this region, through sea-ice shear on the surface waters during the 
melting period, or wind force, indirectly controls nutrient supply to the surface. Similarly, 
Williams and Carmack (2015) pointed to surface stress by ice motion and wind as the 
dominant processes of mixing and circulation in the mid-shelf regions of interior shelves 
in the Arctic, although they did not include the CAA in this study. Input of nutrients 
primarily drives the increase in PP while increasing temperatures likely aid the metabolic 
efficiency of the cells. Furthermore, I propose that water temperature, nutrients and light 
are the main controls of metabolic efficiency and phytoplankton assemblage in waters in 
Cambridge Bay. Tidal suppression, particularly with sea-ice cover, and inhibited wind 
mixing presumably limited nutrient supply. As such, surface NO3- was potentially already

77 
depleted by biological activity prior to our study. Net autotrophy in sea-ice has been 
documented to occur in Dease Straight from as early as May (Campbell et al., 2017), 
which would reduce surface water nutrients and is likely to have occurred in CB. Nutrient 
samples prior to any phytoplankton growth (e.g. February/March) could elucidate how 
much winter accumulation of nutrients occurs in the surface and could give us a better 
understanding of how much drawdown had occurred when the light first returns.  
During PI, the surface were warming to positive temperatures, however, cells 
remained limited by low nutrients and thus small cells dominated the biological activity. 
PII was a phytoplankton transitional period with mixed and unstable transitionary 
phytoplankton assemblages. I propose that the taxonomic regime shift was driven by the 
change in nutrient supply and initial stratification, which resulted in the observed low cell 
numbers and biomass. By phase III, a new condition was reached, from dinoflagellate-
dominant assemblages in PI to a diatom-dominated assemblage in PIII.

Chapter 3 – Exploring the Potential Monitoring Capacity of Cabled 
Observatories in the Arctic as a Proxy for Phytoplankton Dynamics 
3.1 Introduction 
The drive to expand our understanding of the global oceans and seas is being 
motivated by greater international collaboration and technological advancement. A web 
of science (WOS) search containing topics “ocean”, “marine”, “sea” and “coast” and 
refined by WOS categories: Oceanography and Marine Freshwater Biology, demonstrates 
the increase in publications over the last 30 years from 1,259 in 1988 to > 10,000 in 
2017. 
Longer and more intensive time-series and meta-analysis of data sets are enabling 
greater global and in-depth assessments (e.g. Nagelkerken and Connel, 2015; Karl and 
Church, 2014), however with such analysis the complexity of our oceans is becoming 
more apparent. The polar regions are broadly acknowledged as understudied (Wassman 
et al., 2011; Giesbrecht et al., 2018; Blais et al., 2017). The Arctic is of particularly 
concern in the scientific community due to the current rate of climate-driven change 
being observed (Pachauri et al., 2014). The Arctic region is warming at a rate two to 
three times that of the global mean (Pachauri et al., 2014; Wassman et al., 2011).  
In an effort to improve our understanding of the Arctic ecosystem, Oceans 
Networks Canada (ONC) installed in the summer of 2012 a cabled observatory at 7 m 
depth in the summer of 2012, Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, in the Canadian Arctic 
Archipelago (CAA). Initially the observatory was equipped with sensors for conductivity, 
temperature and depth (CTD), oxygen, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), sea-ice 
thickness and chlorophyll a fluorescence (Chl a fl.). Over the last six years the ONC

79 
observatory has been optimised and had more instruments added to the platform (see 
Appendix C). This was a first effort to collect high-resolution data year-round, for an 
extended duration in the CAA via a cabled real-time observatory. As such, it is a unique 
time series, which can aid our understanding of Arctic seasonal cycles, interannual trends 
and variation. Moreover, it has been an opportunity to test the viability of oceanographic 
instruments over long time scales in Arctic. 
In collaboration with ONC, an aim of this project was to compare my in situ field 
data, collected over a 2-month period, to data collected from the ONC observatory. By 
comparing experimental field measurements to data measured by the ONC observatory, I 
evaluated whether the ONC data can be used to assess seasonal phytoplankton biomass 
and primary production in the Arctic without the need for field experimentation. 
Furthermore, based on the agreement between field measurements and the observatory, 
can the ~6 year ONC time series be used to understand interannual phytoplankton 
dynamics beyond the limited scope of the 2016 field season? 
Both 13C incubation experiments and extracted (in vitro) chlorophyll a are 
considered direct measurements of PP and phytoplankton biomass, respectively. 
However, incubation experiments are labour-intensive and difficult to conduct under 
challenging environmental conditions, making long-term high resolution temporal 
monitoring via this method unlikely. Due to the logistical complications incubation based 
experiments are also spatially limited, which likely increases errors when the data is 
extrapolated to a broader area. Moreover, field work in the Arctic costs eight-times that 
of temperate studies (Mallory et al., 2018). Thus, accurately monitoring biological 
production from in situ instrumentation remotely would be a practical and more

80 
sustainable solution that would enable observations throughout the dynamic Arctic 
seasons.  
Phytoplankton biomass has been assessed by chlorophyll a concentrations and to 
some extent fluorescence measurements have been used as an indicator for phytoplankton 
biomass and sometimes primary production in the ocean (Gordon, 1979). As the demand 
to understand the ocean has expanded in the last 50 years, new developments have been 
made to estimate chlorophyll a concentrations through the use of satellites. Satellites use 
the spectral colour of the ocean surface waters and ever-developing algorithms to 
indirectly estimate the global surface chlorophyll a concentrations (e.g. O’Riely et al. 
2000). Moreover, satellite-estimated chlorophyll a has been used as an indirect method to 
assess and model PP (see Carr et al., 2006). An alternate approach to assess PP by Riser 
and Johnson (2008) used continuous measurements from in situ oxygen sensors on 
profiling floats to measure the net oxygen production to evaluate the net autotrophy of 
subtropical gyres. Oxygen solubility in seawater is a function of temperature and salinity. 
Deviations from the expected oxygen saturation values can be attributed to biological 
activity (Garcia et al., 2006), as it is produced through photosynthesis and consumed by 
respiration. The biological Apparent Oxygen Utilisation (AOU) can be used to indicate 
whether the system is net-autotrophic or heterotrophic, although, other mechanisms of 
gas exchange such as wind should be considered (e.g. Ho et al., 2006).  
These methods aid our understanding of the distribution of algal biomass and PP 
in the oceans, and how biomass changes through time, but these methods are not without 
flaws (e.g. satellites cannot measure through sea-ice). With larger datasets becoming 
available, accessible and expanded, these alternate observation methods are progressively

81 
advancing and becoming more reliable. However, continuous methodological 
optimisation is required for greater precision, accuracy and correct interpretation of the 
data.  
Here I present a comparison of in vitro chlorophyll a to in vivo chlorophyll a 
fluorescence to determine whether ONC fluorescence data were representative of 
phytoplankton biomass in surface waters of CB. In addition, I used continuous 
measurements from in situ oxygen, temperature and salinity sensors mounted on the 
ONC observatory to derive biologically produced oxygen (AOU) and compared it to 
measured rC. I present estimated apparent carbon utilisation (ACU) from October 2012 
to March 2018, calculated using a relationship established between AOU and rC. 
Additionally, I discuss seasonal ACU in Cambridge Bay and explore interannual 
variability of ACU in reference to observed water temperature and sea-ice variability.  
3.2 Methods 
3.2.1 Ocean Networks Canada Data 
Oceanographic (seawater temperature, salinity, density, sea-ice thickness, PAR, 
chlorophyll fluorescence, O2 and CO2) and atmospheric data (incoming solar radiation, 
wind speed and air temperature) were downloaded from the Ocean Networks Canada 
Data Archive, Cambridge Bay, Underwater Network recorded from October 2, 2012 to 
March 22, 2018 (Ocean Networks Canada, 2018). All data were downloaded as 1-minute 
averages, which were further averaged to hourly and daily time periods for additional 
analysis.

82 
3.2.2 Field methodology 
Field samples were collected in Cambridge Bay surface waters (5 m) in 2016 
from June 16 to August 3. Refer to section 2.2 (Chapter 2) for specific details about 
sample collection and methodology. The sample period was divided into three time 
phases: Phase I (June 16 – July 1), phase II (July 2 – 13) and phase III (July 14 – August 
3) based on observed changes in environmental conditions (see Chapter 2 for detailed 
explanations of phases I, II and III). 
3.2.3 Calculating Apparent Oxygen and Carbon Utilisation  
Oxygen solubility in seawater is a function of temperature and salinity. Deviations 
from the expected oxygen saturation values can be attributed to biological activity and 
can be estimated from Equation 1, which has been adapted from Garcia et al. (2006). A 
value of AOU >0.0 ml is considered autotrophic.

Where O2, in situ is the concentration of oxygen (mL L-1) measured by the O2 sensor

given the salinity and temperature, assuming surface waters are in equilibrium with the 
atmosphere (Garcia and Gordon, 1992). 
To determine whether the calculated AOU reflected oxygen produced via 
photosynthesis, I compared AOU to rC rates. This relationship was then used to calculate 
an estimation of apparent carbon utilisation (ACU) from the calculated AOU, where c is 
the intercept and m is the slope of the linear fit between AOU and rC.

3.2.4 Data management and times-series analysis 
All data were handled in R software programming. Relationships between field 
measurements and the ONC data were assessed using Pearson’s product-moment 
correlation (r) and the linearity between variables was assessed to a significance of at 
least 95% confidence (p £ 0.05)  
 
To observe trends through the time series, I utilised the robust time-series model 
“Prophet” within R. Prophet foremost is a forecasting tool (Taylor and Letham, 2017) 
that can handle data sets with daily periodicity. Prophet is an additive regressive model, 
which uses a number of forecasting techniques, from autoregressive integrated moving 
averages (ARIMA) to exponential smoothing. The prophet model was applied to our 
calculated ACU, and the model fit the data well, with most data points falling within the 
95% confidence interval (see Appendix D). Although, the model currently works from a 
singular variable to forecast data, I used it to look at seasonal ACU variation. 
I analysed the mean annual cycle of ACU, sea ice and water temperature and 
discussed the interannual trends in variability in Cambridge Bay. To further evaluate the 
amount of heterotrophy in CB, I calculated the area under the curve for each year of 
estimated ACU (see Appendix E) and the average area under the curve spanning all years 
of estimated ACU. 
3.3 Results 
3.3.1 Evaluating chlorophyll a fluorescence as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass 
Relationships between in vitro (TChl a) to daily averaged Chl a fl. (Figure 3.1 A 
and B) and in vitro (TChl a) to Chl a fl. at the hour of field sampling (Figure 3.1 C and D) 
were poor (r = 0.14 and 0.074, p > 0.05, respectively). Moreover, the breakdown of the

84 
sample period, into three time phases showed a variable relationship between TChl a and 
Chl a fl.. TChl a to be negatively correlated to Chl a fl. values in PI (Chapter 2,Table 5) 
and only significantly positively correlated to Chl a fl. in PII (Chapter 2, Table 6). The 
lack of correlation between TChl a and Chl a fl. suggested that the ONC Chl a fl. may not 
be a useful proxy for phytoplankton biomass. 
3.3.2 Estimating Apparent Carbon Utilisation and Apparent Oxygen Utilisation 
from a Cabled Observatory 
3.3.2 (a) Measured Carbon Utilisation and Apparent Oxygen Utilisation 
A regression between the calculated AOU and measured rC (Figure 3.2 A) in CB 
indicated a strong relationship (r = 0.8, p <0.05). Two obvious outliers were not included 
in the regression. As the sea-ice began to break-up it is likely the water column was not in 
a stable state, this dynamic period is likely the cause of the two outliers (June 29 and 30) 
between AOU and rC. The initial calculation of AOU (equation 2) made the assumption 
that the atmosphere and ocean were in equilibrium, which does not hold true when sea ice 
is present. I made the assumption that no oxygen was being added from the atmosphere 
when there was sea- ice coverage and attributed variations in oxygen to biological 
processes. To validate my assumption, greater parameterisation of gas exchange would 
be required during the sea-ice covered period and into the different stages of ice melt in 
Cambridge Bay.  
To investigate seasonal and interannual primary production, I used the daily 
average AOU value, calculated from ONC data spanning from October 2012 to March 
2018, and estimated an ‘apparent carbon utilisation” (ACU) value (Equation 3).

were found in B and D.

86 
To improve my confidence in using ACU as a tool to estimate at long-term carbon 
utilisation, I also cross-compared measured rC to pCO2 (Figure 3.2 B) and then further 
compared the calculated ACU to pCO2 data (Figure 3.3). Similarly to the relationship 
between rC and AOU, the relationship between rC and pCO2 was significant (r = 0.79, p 
<0.01), after omitting the two outliers, suggesting that the seasonal pCO2 drawdown was 
somewhat reflective of carbon utilisation.  
The pCO2 time series from the ONC node is shorter than the O2 time series since 
the pCO2 sensor has only been in situ since October 2015, therefore, inferring 
productivity from O2 measurements is preferable at this time. However, the calculated 
ACU value negatively correlated to pCO2 (r = -0.89, p < 0.01) which further corroborates 
the validity of the estimated ACU value (Figure 3.3). When ACU was < -0.5 µmol C L-1 
d-1 the relationship between ACU and pCO2 was stronger (grey points Figure 3.3, r = -
0.95, p < 0.01). However, the slope and strength of the linear relationship decreased when 
the ACU was approximately > -0.5 µmol C L-1 d-1, while the negative relationship 
remained significant (red points, Figure 3.3, r = -0.76, p <0.01). The first slope (grey 
points in Figure 3.3) corresponds to the November to April period (winter-spring, and 
therefore dark conditions) while the second slope (red points in Figure 3.3) corresponds 
to the May – October period (spring –summer, and therefore light conditions). The 
average daily PAR value at the ONC observatory for all points within the dark period is 
0.285 ± 0.012 µmol photons m2 s-1 while within the light period PAR is on average 46.9 
± 2.01 µmol photons m2 s-1. Moreover, water temperatures in the ‘dark’ period are 
consistently low (-1.45 ± 0.008 °C) compared to the light period in which temperatures 
are warmer  (0.93 ± 0.09 °C) although more variable.

at p <0.01, whereas in the light period (red), the linear strength of the relationship 
decreases to r = -0.76 at p <0.01.

89 
The significant relationships between estimated ACU and measured rC, pCO2 
and calculated AOU suggest that ACU is a viable tool for an assessment of seasonal and 
interannual carbon utilisation by phytoplankton in CB. 
3.3.3 Seasonal and Interannual Variability of ACU, Sea-Ice and Water Temperature 
in Cambridge Bay 
A strong seasonal cycle of ACU was apparent (Figure 3.4). When ACU was 
negative, respiration rates exceed production and the system is net-heterotrophic (ACU < 
0.0 µmol C L-1 d-1). Apparent carbon utilisation is positive (>0.0 µmol C L-1 d-1) when 
production exceeds respiration and therefore the system is net-autotrophic. From late 
March to early April, ACU began to increase, however, the system does not become net 
autotrophic until late-May to mid-June, when more carbon is being utilised rather than 
respired on a daily period (Figure 3.4). The maximum ACU (>0.5 µmol C L-1 d-1 ) occurs 
in the mid-summer between July and August and declines after the peak but the system 
does not become net heterotopic until October. 
To compare interannual variability of measurements in Cambridge Bay, I plotted 
the mean daily averages of ACU, sea ice and water temperature (averaged across all 
years, black solid line) with one standard deviation around the mean (dashed black line) 
(Figures 3.5 – 3.7). Interannual variations around the mean (anomalies) are shown for 
each year in red indicating values above the mean and in blue for values below the mean. 
The grey dotted lines signify the minimum and maximum values for the entire time series 
(Figures 3.5 – 3.7).

original model).

91 
3.3.3 (a) Interannual variability of Apparent Carbon Utilisation in Cambridge Bay 
 
From 2012 to the end of 2014, ACU was above the mean (red) (Figure 3.5). This 
was particularly evident for the winter months, when ACU was net heterotrophic, 
suggesting less remineralisation of carbon to CO2. In 2013 and 2014, approximately 
between late-June to mid-August, ACU was higher than average (red) and the system was 
net-autotrophic, indicating greater carbon utilisation (Figure 3.5). Towards the end of 
2014, and generally persisting through 2016, ACU was below average, thus more 
respiration was occurring in the heterotrophic months and less carbon use in the summer. 
Contrastingly, 2017 shows more annual variability. Early in the 2017 ACU was greater 
than average, less respiration, however, later in 2017 the ACU declined and more 
apparent respiration occurred. These conditions persisted into the beginning of 2018 
(Figure 3.5). 
To assess how heterotrophy changed year to year, I calculated the area under the curve 
from calculated yearly ACU (see Appendix E) when data were available (Table 10) and 
the average area under the curve (averaged ACU across all years, black line in Figure 
3.5). The area under the curve for seasonal averaged ACU in Cambridge Bay was overall 
negative, which suggests that annual C respiration exceeds utilisation and the system is 
net-heterotrophic (Table 10).  
From late 2012 to early 2018, the trend shifted from above average ACU, which 
equates to less respiration and more utilisation of carbon, into a greater sustained period 
of below average ACU - more respiration and less carbon utilisation. Both, 2012 and 
currently 2018 are incomplete data sets thus the ACU could not be fully estimated (Table 
10).

the grey lines are the minimum and maximum daily ACU estimated over the times series. Blue and red

Each year has three phases: Phase I is net-heterotrophic (negative ACU) from the start of the year to when the ACU becomes net-
autotrophic, phase II is the duration that the system is net autotrophic (ACU >0.0 µmol C L-1 d-1) and phase III when the system 
becomes net-heterotrophic again to the end of the year. The average area under the curve is calculated from the mean curve, calculated 
from all available ONC data available.

The most heterotrophic years were 2014, 2015 and 2016. However, in 2014 data was 
missing in August and some extreme low values were detected in July, which may be due 
to instrumental error, As a consequence, ACU is disproportionally low. Thus, 2014 was 
likely less heterotrophic than the area under the curve suggests. The amount of 
heterotrophy was marginally lower in 2017 and was at its lowest in 2013. The highest 
ACU and the lowest respiration occurred in 2013 (Table 10). Overall, the ACU showed a 
strong seasonal cycle in CB with apparent interannual variability. 
3.3.3 (b) Interannual variability of water temperature in Cambridge Bay 
 
Changes in seawater temperature in CB are strongly seasonal, with daily water 
temperature falling below zero from mid-October to mid-late-June and reaching annual 
maxima in August (Figure 3.6). The majority of interannual variation in water 
temperature occurs in the summer, when water temperature increases from June to 
November (Figure 3.6), whereas temperatures are consistently lower in the winter 
months.  
 
From the end of the growing season in 2012 and the initial 2013 growing season, 
water temperatures were above the seasonal mean. At the end of the growing season in 
2013, water temperatures fluctuated, transitioning to 2014 which was the coolest year of 
the time series. Similarly, in 2015 waters were generally colder than average, although 
there were sporadic warm periods. Water temperatures in 2016 were close to the mean; 
however, from July into August they increased and the maximum average daily 
temperatures were recorded. Warmer than average water temperatures generally persisted 
throughout 2017, although the data set for this year is incomplete. Data available for 2018 
was only considered until March and thus annual variability could not be estimated..

one standard deviation and the grey lines are the minimum and maximum daily water temperature 
measured over the times series. Blue and red colours indicate when water temperature fell below or above 
the mean, respectively.

96 
3.3.3 (c) Interannual variability of sea ice cover in Cambridge Bay 
Sea-ice cover in CB has a strong seasonal cycle with ice beginning to form in 
October and gradually increasing in thickness to a seasonal maximum in early June 
(Figure 3.7), after which there is a rapid melt period with ice-free water persisting from 
July to October.  
In 2012 and 2013, sea-ice thickness was close to the times-series daily mean. In 
2013, the number of sea-ice free days (IFD) was at its highest (Figure 3.7), however, at 
the end of 2013, ice was thicker than average. This trend persisted for all 2014 with 
consistently thicker ice coverage and a later melt, resulting in the lowest number of IFD 
(Figure 3.7). Similarly to 2012 and 2013, sea-ice thickness in both 2015 and 2016 
fluctuated around the mean with a similar number of IFD. However, from the autumn 
freeze of 2016 onwards into March 2018 sea-ice thickness consistently remained below 
average (Figure 3.7).

3.4 Discussion 
3.4.1 Variability in fluorescence: A cellular response to excess light 
I originally hypothesised that the long-term Chl a fl. could be used as a proxy for 
phytoplankton biomass, however, my results suggest that Chl a fl. had a weak 
relationship to in vitvo TChl a. I explored physiological processes in phytoplankton and 
fluorometric methodology theory to understand the discrepancy between the measured in 
vitro chlorophyll a and the in vivo fluorescence measured by the ONC observatory.  
In vivo fluorescence is used to estimate chlorophyll a based on an established 
relationship between extracted chlorophyll a values and the measured fluorescent 
response of cells in a known water volume and under constant light excitation (Roseler 
and Barnard, 2013). However, to estimate biomass using fluorescence, we assume that 
the excitation irradiance, chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient and quantum yield 
are constant across all species of phytoplankton, in all growth phases and environmental 
conditions (Roseler and Barnard, 2013), which is not always the case.  
Re-radiation of energy as fluorescence is one of three pathways in which excess 
energy is dissipated. The two other pathways are through the release of thermal energy 
and the utilisation of energy in a photochemical reaction e.g. photosynthesis (Falkowski 
and Raven, 2007). When the photosystem reaction centres are open and trapping 
electrons, emited fluorescence should be lower. In contrast, when the reaction centres 
close or are at capacity (i.e. light saturated), excitement energy is not directed into 
photochemical reactions but it is re-radiated as fluorescence, thus fluorescence should 
then be at its maximum emission point (Falkowski and Raven, 2007). The ratio of 
photons re-radiated to absorbed (used in photochemical reactions) is defined as the

99 
quantum yield of fluorescence, whereby the yield would increase when more photons are 
directed to the fluorescent pathway.  
The lack of the relationship between TChl a and Chl a fl. in CB is likely due to 
excess photon exposure at the surface (i.e. higher PAR) that resulted in a reduction in the 
quantum yield of fluorescence. This is demonstrated in a diurnal periodicity seen in the 
higher resolution (per minute) plots of the Chl a fl. (Figure 3.8 A) and PAR (Figure 3.8 
B) and their inverse relationship (Figure 3.8 A and B), which resulted in a negative 
correlation between the daily averaged Chl a fl. and PAR (r = -0.8, p <0.01, Figure 3.9). 
The Chl a fl. and PAR relationship was far stronger than the relationship measured 
between the in vitro TChl a and Chl a fl. (r = 0.141, p > 0.05). However, the negative Chl 
a fl. to PAR relationship was only present and significant post the sea-ice break (PII and 
PIII, Table 6 and 7, Chapter 2), when the mean daily average PAR was an order of 
magnitude higher than in PI (Table 2, Chapter 2).  
The reduction of Chl a fl. under increased light conditions is contrary to the 
anticipated increase, expected when light saturation occurs, and is likely a phenomenon 
known as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) (Falkowski and Kolber, 1995). NPQ is a 
cellular response to high irradiances and light super saturation where cells dissipate 
excess energy thermally, rather than as fluorescence, reducing the fluorescent signal by 
up to 90% (Huot and Babin, 2010). Thermal radiation of energy protects the cell light 
harvesting pigments from damage by excessive excitation energy and potential free 
radicals (Murchie and Lawson, 2013). I suggest that the daily fluctuations of surface Chl 
a fl. observed in Cambridge Bay are the result of NPQ. In the Arctic, continuous light

102 
present in the summer has the potential for sustained NPQ, where maximum fluorescence 
yield may never be met, as the photosystems may never get the opportunity to recover 
(Ruban et al., 2004). Thus, the Chl a fl. in CB may not reflect phytoplankton biomass as 
calculated by the traditional relationship of in vivo to in vitro chlorophyll a (Slovacek and 
Hannan, 1977), which is likely the cause of the lack of a relationship between in vitro 
TChl a and Chl a fl. observed in this study (Figure 3.1 A-D).  
Extending this further to the yearly cycle, Chl a fl.  appeared to have two peaks 
per growing season (Figure 3.10 A and B). Initial interpretation of these data would 
suggest that multiple blooms of phytoplankton occurred. The first potential 
phytoplankton bloom occurred in spring (April-June 2016, Figure 3.10 B), while sea ice 
was still present and a second bloom peaked in autumn (post October, Figure 3.10 B) . 
This bi-modal distribution is typical in regions that stratify and become nutrient limited in 
the summer months, where fall mixing replenishes nutrients to drive a secondary bloom 
(Lalli and Parsons, 2006). In Cambridge Bay, both peaks of Chl a fl. in 2016 were 
observed in the surface when PAR was <200 µmol m2 s-1 (Figure 3.10 B and C).  
What remains unclear is whether the multiple peaks of annual Chl a fl. are 
indicating a maximum in phytoplankton biomass or are a physiological artefact of the 
phytoplankton’s relationship with light. Based on the seasonal cycle in the ACU data 
(Figure 3.4 and 3.5), I would expect a singular peak in chlorophyll biomass. The two 
peaks of Chl a fl. appear at the expected time, if we assume a physiological interaction 
with light was occurring in the water column. The mismatch between the Chl a fl. to in 
vitro chlorophyll a due to light dependency was noted early in the literature (e.g.

103 
Slovacek and Hannan, 1977), and is a complication that should be considered when using 
fluorometric measurements as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass.

3.4.2 Apparent Carbon Utilisation and Environmental Variability 
The calculated ACU value suggested that net-autotrophy occurred in CB surface 
waters from late May to mid-Jun. Campbell et al. (2017) found net heterotrophy within 
the sea ice in late April, and consistent net-autotrophy from early-mid May onwards. The 
timing of net-autotrophy in CB surface waters is slightly later than biological production 
reported in sea-ice by Campbell et al. (2017) in Dease Strait. Phytoplankton have 
prolonged light limitation comparative to the ice-algal cells, which are adapted to 
growing earlier in the season (Barlow et al., 1988) and may explain the timing 
discrepancies between our study and Campbell et al., (2017). While the system does 
reach net-autotrophic conditions, the seasonal ACU is dominated by net-heterotrophy 
(Table 10). This suggests that CB is likely a net source of CO2, which is in agreement 
with Chen and Borges (2009) assessment that most inner estuaries and near-shore coastal 
regions are sources of CO2 to the atmosphere.  
By simply looking at the variation of sea-ice thickness and water temperature 
from 2012-2018, environmental interannual variability becomes clear in CB. The largest 
deviation from the mean daily water temperatures occurred in 2014, when the ice was 
consistently much thicker and moreover, the water temperature was colder than average. 
Water temperature has been found to be a dominant control of bacterial respiration and 
carbon consumption (e.g. Apple et al., 2006). The ACU in 2014 was higher than the 
average throughout the year and given that the water was cooler (Figure 3.6), it is 
possible that less respiration would have occurred. Kirchman et al. (2009) found the 
largest increase in bacterial growth rates in water temperatures of -1.8 to 3.9°C, after 
which growth rates increased, but at rates 10-fold lower. In CB, water temperatures

106 
seasonally transition from -1.6°C to maximums of 9.8°C, with the average annual 
maximum of ~6°C. For most of the year daily water temperatures fall between -1.8 and 
3.9°C, where bacteria growth increases at a larger rate with small changes in temperature. 
As temperature deviations occur each year, we would thus expect changes in bacterial 
activity. In contrast, the largest apparent heterotrophy occurred in 2015, when water 
temperatures were cooler than the average, disputing the theory of colder waters lowering 
respiration rates. This contradiction indicates that more variables should be considered. 
Kirchman et al. (2009) attributed 20% of the variation in bacterial growth rate happening 
below 4°C to temperature, suggesting that dissolved organic matter supply was an 
important co-control factor on bacterial growth. Yet in 2016 we have one of the largest 
peaks in carbon fixation followed by warmer waters in 2017; thus we would anticipate 
that in 2017 greater heterotrophy was supported, however, although still large, it did not 
exceed previous values.  
The respiration of zooplankton and other organisms would contribute to C 
dynamics in Cambridge Bay, and thus influence the calculated ACU value, however the 
environmental controls on respiration rates remain poorly constrained (Darnis et al., 
2017). A recent study in Svalbard suggests that zooplankton community daily respiration 
rates within surface layers (upper 40m) are higher in January to March and initially 
decrease with the return of the sun due to diel vertical migration patterns (Darnis et al., 
2017). Thus it is likely that zooplankton dynamics contributed to the seasonal rates of 
carbon utilisation and interannual variability in CB, but specific research would be 
required to further quantify the extent of their impact.

107 
Furthermore, due to the shallow water column and location of the ONC 
observatory it is possible that metabolic processes by ice benthic algae may influence 
water column oxygen concentrations, and subsequently my the ACU value, however 
further research would be needed to constrain the magnitude and timing of their 
influence.  
It has been predicted that PP would increase with longer ice-free periods (e.g. 
Arrigo and van Djiken, 2015). In CB, the highest number of IFD were in 2013 and 2016 
(106 IFD). These years both had above average net-production, whereas,  2014 showed 
the lowest number of IFD and had the lowest estimated summer net-heterotrophy, which 
potentially corroborates Arrigo and van Djiken (2015) findings, although data is missing 
from 2014. 
 
Many Arctic time-series studies have documented high interannual variability of 
biological activity and environmental conditions in the Arctic. Grebmeir et al (2010) 
found no trends between satellite-derived chlorophyll concentrations and sea-ice retreats, 
and seasonal sea-ice loss between 2003 and 2008 in the Pacific Arctic. However, in 
higher trophic levels, the impacts of sea-ice loss were observed. Grebmeir et al. (2010) 
suggested that some unconstrained change in primary production, due to sea-ice loss, was 
cascading up through the trophic system. Giesbrecht et al. (2018) presented a ten-year 
study of the Pacific Arctic region and discerned no clear increasing or decreasing trends 
of any environmental trends through time. While a lot more research has occurred in the 
Arctic, there is certainly more research that needs to be conducted to increase the 
resolution of our data to understand the variability. Indeed, the majority of published 
studies points to the necessity of more data in order to draw meaningful conclusions.

108 
While analysing the interannual variability of ACU enables us to extract information 
about potential biological activity with regards to environmental variability, it is still a 
very preliminary long-term productivity proxy and poses many more questions, which 
could be addressed by more research in space and time. 
3.5 Future improvements to constrain phytoplankton dynamics via cabled 
observatories 
3.5.1 Biomass estimates in the Arctic 
The question remains: can the ONC in vivo chlorophyll a fluorescence be used as 
a proxy of phytoplankton biomass, when the fluorescence may never reach a maximal 
quantum yield? At the daily minimal PAR in CB, phytoplankton cells may still be the 
effects of NPQ, as with greater levels of NPQ, recovery is slower (Rudan et al., 2004). 
Thus, cells may still be quenched when exposed to 24 h of light and therefore Chl a fl. 
may no longer be a robust proxy for biomass. A way to confirm whether NPQ persists at 
the lowest daily PAR in CB would require further experimentation, one such method is 
the addition of NH4Cl, which acts as an inhibitor of NPQ (Rudan et al., 2004). 
Potential future in situ correction options may be: 
A) Treating algal cells with DCMU (3-(3,4dichloro-phenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea) to 
attempt to block electron transport, which in turn forces maximum quantum yield 
of fluorescence (e.g. Falkowski and Kiefer, 1985).  
B) Adapting cells to the dark and measuring the difference between fluorescence at a 
low light intensity and after brief saturating light pulse (e.g. Murchie and Lawson, 
2013).  
However, to collect high-resolution data, one option would be to install an alternate 
instrument, such as the WET Labs ac9 absorption meter. This sensor works on the

109 
premise of multiple absorption wavelengths and attenuations, and the calculation of an 
absorption line height parameter at the peak absorption at 676 nm from a linear baseline 
between 650 – 715 nm (e.g. Roseler and Barnard, 2013). 
 
These solutions would be applicable for future research, however ONC has over 
six years of Chl a fl. data, which could potentially be used in time-series analysis to 
assess changes in biomass over time. Thus, correction options for the already-collected 
data should be explored. Halverson and Pawlowicz (2013) faced the same problem with 
fluorescence instruments recording at 2 m depths mounted on ferries commuting between 
the mainland and islands of the west coast of British Columbia. They made a correction 
to fluorescence data by assuming a linear change in biomass over a day and extrapolating 
between fluorescence measurements made at dusk and dawn (Figure 3 in Halverson and 
Pawlowicz, 2013). This is one option for the Cambridge Bay data, yet still we would be 
making the assumption that there was no residual or accumulative quenching from the 
previous day. While not a perfect option for the Arctic data set, it is perhaps worth further 
exploration considering the uniqueness of this data set and the limited availability of data 
in the Arctic. 
2.5.2 Future Optimisation of the ACU Parameter 
The strong trends observed between rC, pCO2 and with calculated ACU suggest 
the ACU is a viable approach to look at long-term changes in carbon utilisation in CB. 
However, Equation 2 does not include a wind component, which is documented to impact 
surface gas exchange at the ocean-atmospheric interface (Ho et al., 2006; Wanninkhof 
and McGillis,1999). Applying a wind coefficient during the open water period to account

110 
for wind-driven gas exchange (e.g. Ho et al., 2006) could improve the ACU calculation 
and reduce any over or underestimation of biologically produced O2. For this study, I 
concluded that the data required (e.g. water column structure) to make this amendment 
were not well enough constrained within the oceanographic data I had available (see 
Appendix F). While a wind parameter may further optimise the ACU calculation, 
previous apparent oxygen utilisation calculations have been applied on a global scale to 
assess primary production, without the inclusion of wind components (e.g. Garcia et al., 
2006). 
Future parameterisation of gas exchange during sea-ice melt in CB may improve 
the ACU calculations, however, the current calculation can still be considered an 
indicator of PP. Indeed the relationship between rC to AOU was strongest when there 
was sea-ice coverage (r = 0.98, p <0.01, Figure 3.1 (curve not shown)) suggesting that O2 
mainly originated from biological activity. Therefore, I suggest here that the approach 
used in this study enables an initial assessment of long-term biological carbon utilisation 
via data collected by a cabled observatory in the Arctic. 
Moreover, the ACU had a strong relationship with pCO2 (Figure 3.3). Although 
pCO2 is not a direct measurement of dissolved inorganic carbon utilisation, the 
correlation with ACU indicates that it can be a representative proxy of PP, even if the 
impacts of physical processes on the solubility of pCO2 are not taken into account. Our 
observed shift in the pCO2 and ACU relationship (grey to red points, Figure 3.3) is likely 
a reflection of a change from a closed sea-ice covered system, when respiration is the 
dominant process and temperature is consistently low (Figures 3.5 and 3.6), to a more 
dynamic period when water temperature is more variable (Figure 3.6), primary

111 
production begins, respiration is still occurring and eventually air-gas exchange can 
occur. Furthermore, the use of pCO2 as a proxy for productivity is supported by its 
positive correlation to our direct measurements of rC (r = 0.796, p <0.01). Ongoing 
testing of the Pro-Oceanus CO2-Pro CV sensor suggests that, after long-term in situ 
deployment, the instrument remains stable (P. Duke and Dr. Brent Else, University of 
Calgary, personal communication). Additionally, Patrick Duke and Dr. Brent Else from 
the University of Calgary aim to calculate long term DIC values using a pCO2 sensor , a 
pH sensor and in situ calibration, which could be used to infer biological carbon 
utilisation (e.g. Emerson et al., 2011 and Hamme et al., 2010). Alongside my ACU 
estimation using the cabled observatory data, the development of high resolution DIC 
monitoring would aid the refinement of the estimated biological utilisation of carbon and 
confidence in long-term PP predictions in CB.  
 
3.6 Conclusion 
 
I present an initial assessment of annual and interannual phytoplankton activity in 
Cambridge Bay from 2012 to 2018 using Apparent Oxygen Utilisation estimates based 
on measured O2, temperature and salinity by the ONC cabled observatory. I suggest 
that data collection and interpretation of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence measured via 
fluorometry by the ONC observatory in CB is likely not an accurate measurement of 
phytoplankton biomass. Estimated carbon utilisation rates in the surface water of CB 
show a strong seasonal cycle, with annual net-autotrophy peaking in early July. The 
estimated apparent carbon utilisation rates suggest that the surface waters in CB are 
annually net-heterotrophic. Furthermore, I infer that annual carbon respiration may be

112 
linked to water temperature changes and potentially the availability of organic carbon. 
Moreover, annual carbon utilisation maybe higher with a longer ice-free period in CB. 
Chlorophyll fluorescence in CB was associated with PAR, which suggests that non-
photochemical quenching caused a breakdown in the relationship between in 
vitro chlorophyll a and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. My results indicate that 
an alternative method to measure biomass in the Arctic surface water should be 
considered. At the very least, a correction of in vivo chlorophyll a fluorescence would be 
necessary to interpret the observatory data as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass.  
High-resolution data sets are important tools for understanding seasonal cycles 
and interannual variability. This study demonstrated the potential for a long-term 
assessment using cabled observatories in the Arctic. However, as this study was limited 
to surface waters, more spatial coverage would be required to gain a better understanding 
of Arctic phytoplankton dynamics. Although preliminary the analysis done here is a 
novel approach for the Arctic and emphasises the potential of observatory high-resolution 
data sets not only as a tool to look at biological variability but also environmental 
variability, which is of particular concern in this period of climate-driven change.

113 
Chapter 4 – General Conclusion 
 
In this thesis, I presented a seasonal study of phytoplankton dynamics in the 
surface waters of the Arctic and I link seasonal phytoplankton changes to environmental 
variables measured in situ and by the ONC cabled observatory. I found that 
phytoplankton biomass and primary production were on average low for the entire study 
period, and suggest this is due to low nitrate concentrations. I attribute the replenishment 
of nitrate availability in surface waters primarily to wind driven mixing in Cambridge 
Bay. Further, I documented a change in phytoplankton taxa over the season whereby, a 
transition from a flagellate-dominated to a diatom-dominated assemblage was observed. I 
propose that shifting environmental conditions in Cambridge Bay, from sea-ice cover to 
warmer open waters, caused the observed taxonomic regime shift, resulting in 
significantly different phytoplankton assemblages between June 16 – July 1 (PI) and July 
24 – August 3 (mid PIII onwards).  
Furthermore, I compared carbon utilisation rates measured in situ with calculated 
biologically-produced oxygen, calculated from the ONC observatory data, and 
extrapolated the relationship to data collected from October 2012 to March 2018 in an 
initial attempt to assess interannual changes in carbon utilisation rate by phytoplankton. 
The comparison of experimental field data and the data collected by the ONC 
observatory indicates that cabled observatories have the potential to monitor long-term 
biological activity in the Arctic. However, I suggest that a correction of the in vivo 
fluorescence data would be necessary to use it as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. 
Future research should focus on validating the apparent carbon utilisation estimates

114 
presented here for Cambridge Bay to confirm its validity as a long-term predictor of 
carbon utilisation.

Appendix D: Modelled Apparent Carbon Utilisation Data 
I utilised the robust time-series model “Prophet” within R to analyse trends in the CB 
time series. Prophet foremost is a forecasting tool (Taylor and Letham, 2017) that can 
handle data sets with daily periodicity. The Prophet model was applied to our calculated 
ACU and the modelled trends fit well to the calculated ACU data with most points falling 
within the 95% confidence intervals, reiterating that the model had a robust fit. After 
fitting the model the seasonal and interannual trends could be extracted (Figure 3.8 A and 
B). The modelled seasonal trends of ACU confirm that the utilisation of carbon begins to 
increase in April, with the peak occurring just post July 1. Likewise, the modelled ACU 
becomes net positive around mid-late May and negative again in late October.  
 
The forecasts produced from the model should be considered with extreme 
caution, particularly given the limitation of the relatively short length of the ONC time 
Figure A.0.2: Apparent carbon utilisation (ACU) estimated from the daily apparent 
oxygen utilisation values (AOU) from October 2012 – March 2018 (black points) 
with a “forecast” going into 2019. The blue line is the “Prophet” model of the data 
based on exponential smoothing and moving averages, the shaded blue area 
represents the 95% confidence interval.

series in terms of ocean process. Further, while the model is able to produce forecast 
based on historical data, it is based only on the one variable, calculated ACU, which 
given the additive effect of environmental variables explored in chapter 2 is uncertain.

Annual net-heterotrophy was determined by calculating the area under the curve of

concentrations from 2015 onwards. Net heterotrophy is shown in grey and net autotrophy in orange.

134 
Appendix F: Future improvements of Apparent Carbon Utilisation Estimates in 
Cambridge Bay 
I found a strong relationship between calculated AOU and rC measured over the 
summer season of 2016. This relationship was extrapolated to the full oxygen data set 
ONC it to asses long term biological activity in Cambridge Bay in terms of ‘apparent’ 
carbon utilisation. This approach perhaps should be considered a rough estimate of 
biological activity for a number of reasons. One reason for caution is that this study only 
had direct measurements of carbon utilisation for a small portion of a singular year. Thus, 
future field sampling and rate-based measurements would be advisable to confirm the 
relationship between rC and AOU. Additionally, measurements of respiration rates and 
bacterial activity would likely enable us to improve the ACU estimate and clarify 
remineralisation of carbon in Cambridge Bay with greater certainty. 
Furthermore, abiotic process, such as wind, will propagate error with the estimated 
AOU value (Ho et al. , 2006) used to calculate the ACU. A more rigorous approach 
would be to use the ratio between Oxygen and Argon to estimate net community 
production (e.g. Reuer et al., 2007), however, this analysis was beyond the scope of my 
study. 
The relationship was weaker between rC and AOU after the sea-ice broke (r = 0.497, 
p <0.3, data not shown) and the water was exposed to wind processes. As an initial 
attempt to account for any atmospheric gas input (greater oxygen input within the surface 
waters on windy days), I applied Ho et al. (2006) wind and gas transfer velocity equation 
(equation 4) based on short-term steady winds: 
! = 0.266 ∗() 
Equation 4

135 
Where U2 is the wind speed (m s-1) squared from the meteorological shore station. This is 
an adaption from Ho et al. (2006), which uses shipboard wind measurements corrected to 
10 m following atmospheric stability algorithms, whereas in our case we just use the 
average daily wind speed for simplicity. This can then be applied similarly to Reuer et al. 
(2007) equation for Net Community Production with some adaptation. The Reuer et al. 
(2007) equation incorporated a term called ‘biological oxygen saturation’ using oxygen 
and argon ratios to isolate biological produced oxygen, similar to my AOU value. Here, I 
use instead the AOU value to constrain biologically produced oxygen (eq. 5): 
*+, =  ./( ∗! ∗0 
Equation 5 
Where k is the gas transfer velocity (m s-1) from equation 4 and 0 is the seawater density 
(kg L-1).  
 
NCP is calculated in  units, which when there is sea-ice coverage and zero wind, 
NCP to becomes zero, this becomes problematic when comparing values during sea-ice 
coverage and open waters. For the exploratory purpose of determining whether a wind 
element in the equation would improve the relationship between an observatory-based 
estimated biological production parameter and my measured rC, I initially looked at only 
the ice-free period.  
 
After calculating the NCP and plotting it against the rC, I found that the 
correlation decreased from July 1 to August 3 (r = -0.02, p = 0.9). I infer that the water 
column remained strongly stratified until July 14, which potentially could have acted like 
sea-ice and the system remained “closed”.  Hence, trying to calculate gas fluctuations 
may not be representative of the oxygen concentrations at 8 m depth where the ONC

136 
node is located. Focusing on the period of time where I assume mixing is occurring 
substantially reduced my rC sample size (n = 6) and did not vastly improve the 
relationship between NCP and rC, and further I made a number of potentially erroneous 
assumptions. Thus, I concluded that without further data (e.g. water column structure) 
this approach became unreliable and was not pursued further.
