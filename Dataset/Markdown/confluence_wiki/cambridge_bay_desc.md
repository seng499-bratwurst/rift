Cambridge Bay Coastal Community Observatory

Background

The hamlet of Cambridge Bay is the largest community in the Kitikmeot Region, located

on Victoria Island, Nunavut, within Inuit Territory. Cambridge Bay is known in the

Inuinnaqtun language as Ikaluktutiak, meaning “many fish”. Inuit have been hunting and

fishing in Cambridge Bay for hundreds of years. A permanent Inuit community was

established in the region in the 1940s and has grown to be a diverse and vibrant

community where the residents and visitors continue to travel, hunt, and fish.

With a growing population and increasing development in the region, the need for

environmental monitoring has also grown. Oceanographic monitoring in the region has

been driven by many factors such as increased shipping traffic, climate pressures,

changing ice-free seasons, and the implications they have on traditional harvesting and

cultural practices. The Arctic Ocean is partially covered by ice for most of the year;

seasonal melting and freezing of the ice cause changes in surface temperature and

salinity. The Arctic is rapidly changing due to climate change; it is imperative to collect

baseline data to understand these changes better.

To support the efforts for baseline data collection in a changing world, the Cambridge

Bay Community Observatory was deployed in 2012 by the Innovation Centre at Ocean

Networks Canada and was the first of its kind in Canada. The observatory is a

partnership between the community of Cambridge Bay and Ocean Networks Canada.

The observatory houses an underwater platform that sits at a depth of ~5–10 m. It has

several instruments, including a CTD (measuring Conductivity, Temperature, and

pressure of the water, which are used to derive the salinity, Depth, and density), an

oxygen sensor, a fluorometer, a turbidity sensor, a hydrophone, an underwater camera,

and an ice profiler. There is also a shore-based time-lapse camera and a weather

station in addition to the undersea instruments. The weather station measures air

temperature, wind chill temperature, humidity, global radiation, wind speed, wind

direction, air pressure, and air density. An AIS (Automatic Identification System) antenna

was later installed in 2013 nearby at the Regional Government offices. Together, these

instruments provide insight into the water conditions of the bay, ice conditions,

atmospheric-ocean interactions, and benthic and near-shore water properties.

The ONC ground-based AIS receiver in Cambridge Bay was the first to be installed in

the Arctic, with the Canadian Coast Guard installing their own a couple of years later.

The installation of an AIS receiver in Cambridge Bay was driven by the need for

increased vessel traffic monitoring in the Arctic. For example, a concern raised by

community project partners in the Arctic is the impact vessel traffic has on sea ice

formation, how this impacts their ability to travel over it safely, and how it may have

implications for caribou migrations. A study by Hussain et al. (2021) found that

increased vessel activity extending beyond the traditional shipping times contributes to

the amplification of polar warming in the northern regions at high latitudes. Vessels

influence the sea-ice coverage and formation, and in doing so, they extend the period

that the ocean can absorb solar heat, thereby adding to Arctic sea temperature rise.
