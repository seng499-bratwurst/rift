| WATERSAMPLER | Water sampler | Water Sampler | Water samplers are devices that collect physical samples of fluid. They can be remotely triggered, either manually or automatically, with a set schedule. Upon recovery, the fluid-filled containers can be processed to determine their chemical and biological constituents. |
| WAVE\_BUOY | Wave Buoy | Wave Buoy | Wave buoys provide measurements of wave conditions. Measurements include wave height, period, direction, and spread. |
| WAVELENGTHOPTICALMODULE | Wavelength Shifting Optical Module | Wavelength Shifting Optical Module | The Wavelength Shifting Optical Module (WOM) measures ultraviolet photons within its instrumented volume. It is constructed as a cylindrical tube painted with a wavelength shifting optical color. Inside the tube, the photons get absorbed and re-emitted in an optical regime where they are readout via two photomultiplier tubes. |
| WETLABS\_WQM | Water Quality Monitor | Water Quality Monitor | Water Quality Monitors (WQM) have sensors to measure temperature, salinity, depth, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence, turbidity and backscattering data. |
| WINDMONITOR | Wind Monitoring System | Wind Monitoring System | Wind monitoring systems measure the speed and direction of wind. |
