A variety of chemicals absorb light in the UV, and each of these chemicals has a unique absorption spectrum. Concentration of these chemicals can be determined directly, with no chemical manipulation, by measuring the absorption spectrum of seawater in the UV and then deconvolving the spectra to yield the concentration of each component."
